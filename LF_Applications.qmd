## Intersecting Lines
As you saw earlier, graphs are one of the ways commonly used to represent linear functions. By examining graphs of linear functions, we learn a lot about the function. For example, we can quickly tell whether a function is increasing (positive slope), decreasing (negative slope) or neither (zero slope). We can also get a sense of how fast the output values are changing with change in the input values.
In order to leverage this benefit of graphs to compare multiple linear functions, it is often helpful to graph the functions on the same grid.

**Consider the claim below:** 

If two linear functions with **different** rates of change are graphed on the same grid, then, the lines must intersect at some point. 
Do you think this claim is true? Why or why not?

In the world of business and economics, **supply** and **demand** problems are sometimes modeled using linear functions. When the demand and supply meet (intersect) we have an equilibrium point. Consider the following example:

**Example 1**

The supply, in thousands of items, for custom phone cases can be modeled by the equation, $s(p)=0.5+1.2p$ while the demand can be modeled by $d(p)=8.7−0.7p$, where p is in the price in dollars. Find the equilibrium price and quantity, the intersection of the supply and demand curves.

***Solution***

There are two ways to solve this problem. First, you can set up $s(p)=d(p)$ then solve algebraically for $p$ or simply graph the two functions then look at the point of intersection.

Let us do both.

*Graphical solution* :

For the graphical solution, you simply graph the two functions (you can use tools such as desmos or geogebra) and read out the coordinates of the intersection point.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create a sequence of x-values
x <- seq(-10, 10, length.out = 100)

# Calculate y-values for each function
y_f <- 0.5 + 1.2 * x
y_g <- 8.7 - 0.7 * x

# Create the plot
plot(x, y_f, type = "l", col = "blue", xlab = "price, p", ylab = "quantity", main = "Graph of d(p) and s(p)")
lines(x, y_g, col = "red")
legend("topright", legend = c("d(p)", "s(p)"), col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1)
grid()
```

The approximate point of intersection for the graphs is $(4.3,5.6)$. You can get more accurate values using technology. This intersection is a pair $(x,y)$ where the first number is the price (input) and the second if the quantity (output).


*Algebraic solution*:

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
  0.5+1.2p&=8.7−0.7p\\ \\
  1.2p+0.7p&=8.7-0.5\\ \\
  1.9p&=8.2\\ \\
  p&=\frac{8.2}{1.9}\\ \\
  &=4.32
\end{align}
```
Thus, the equilibrium price is approximately \$4.32.

To find the quantity associated with this price, use any of the two functions to evaluate the output at $p=4.32$. It does not matter which function you use because both of them have the same output value at the point of intersection (a shared point).

```{=tex}
\begin{align}
s(4.32)&=0.5+(1.2\times 4.32)\\ \\
&= 5.68
\end{align}
```

Thus, the two approaches give us the same solution.
