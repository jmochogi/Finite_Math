## Definitions and Notation for Linear Functions

As you hop into a taxicab in Allentown, the meter will immediately read \$3.30; this is the "drop" charge made when the taximeter is activated. After that initial fee, the taximeter will add \$2.40 for each mile the taxi drives. In this scenario, the total taxi fare depends upon the number of miles ridden in the taxi, and we can ask whether it is possible to model this type of scenario with a function. Using descriptive variables, we choose $m$ for miles and $C$ for Cost in dollars as a function of miles: $C(m)$.

Here, $C(0)$ means the cost for travelling 0 miles (assuming you have entered the taxi). This cost is $\$3.3$. We can write this mathematically as

``` toml
C(0)=3.3
```

Similarly, $C(2)$ is the cost of travelling 2 miles and can be computed as

``` toml
C(2) = 3.3 + (2.4 x 2) = 8.1
```

Here, we take the base charge of $\$3.3$ and add it to the charge for riding 2 miles to get a grand total of 8.1.

In general, if we travel $m$ miles, we can compute the cost as

``` toml
C(m)=3.3 + 2.4m
```

It is often useful to think carefully about the units of each component and how they relate. The expression below shows how this plays out in our taxi context:

$$C(m)=3.3 \hspace{.1in} dollars + 2.4 \hspace{.08in} \frac{dollars}{mile} \times m\hspace{.1in} miles$$

When dollars per mile are multiplied by a number of miles, the result is a number of dollars, matching the units on the 3.30, and matching the desired units for the C function. This means the units for the output, C(m), will be dollars.

We call a relationship such as this, a ***Function*** of $m$. This function takes $m$ (the miles traveled) as the ***Input*** and produces $C(m)$ (the cost of travelling $m$ miles) as the ***Output***. As you will learn shortly, this is an example of a ***Linear Function***. There are other types of functions (e.g., exponential, quadratic, etc.). In this course, the main focus is on linear functions. We will learn how to model real life situations and find their solutions by leveraging the ideas learned under linear functions.

There are two parts to the function, the first part (3.3) represents the FIXED charge while the VARIABLE part, $2.4m$ which represents the charge for m miles. The cost of a ride, $C(m)$ will vary as the number of miles, $m$ varies. Furthermore, this cost varies by a factor of 2.4 which means that for every additional mile you ride, you will pay $\$ 2.4$ more. We call the value $2.4$ a ***Rate of Change*** for the function $C(m)$. Since this rate of change stays the same over any interval, we say that the rate is ***Constant***.

## Function Representations

In the above section, we described the taxi cost function using words and represented it using a formula. Functions can also be represented using tables and graphs.

Consider the table below:

***Have table here***

We can also represent the function using a graph as shown below:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Generate x values
x <- seq(0, 10, by = 1)

# Create a data frame with x and y values
data <- data.frame(x = x, y = 2.4 * x + 3.3)

# Create the plot using ggplot with custom y scale
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "miles", y = "Cost", title = "Graph of C(m) = 2.4m + 3.3") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30))  # Set y-axis limits

```

In the graph, we place the miles on the horizontal axis and the cost on the vertical axis axis. Since the cost is dependent on the miles traveled, we call it a ***Dependent Variable***. Similarly, we call the miles, an ***Independent Variable***.

If you ride 0 miles, the cost is \$3.30, giving the point (0, 3.30) on the graph. We call this, the vertical or C(m)-intercept (or y-intercept in a general graph using x and y). In many applications, the y-intercept often means the initial value (e.g., cost) when the x value (in this case miles) is zero.

We call the above function, a ***Linear Function*** because its graph produces a straight line. In general, linear functions take the form $f(x)=mx+b$ where $m$ is the ***Slope*** (or rate of change) and $b$ is the y-intercept. Note that $b$ and/or $m$ can take any values including zero.

By convention, we place the output values on the vertical ($y$) axis and so, $y$ can be used in place of $f(x)$. Hence, we can rewrite the above function as an equation: $$y=mx+b$$


## Increasing and Decreasing Functions

Notice in the above example that as you increase the number of miles, the cost of the ride goes up. This is because the rate of change (m) is positive.

Since as you increase the input value, the output value increases, we say that the function $C(m)$ is an increasing function. As can be seen on the graph, the line is rising from left to right. This is because the rate of change value is positive.

Generally, a linear function is said to be ***increasing*** if the slope $m$ is positive and

***decreasing*** if it is negative.

**EXERCISE**

``` toml
1. Create a real-life scenario that can be modelled by a decreasing linear function
2. Write the formula for the function and graph it.
3. What would the graph of the function, f(x)= 0x+5 look like? Notice here m = 0. 
```
