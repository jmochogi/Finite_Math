# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the world of finite mathematics! I have crafted this course pack to serve as your compass through the intriguing landscape of finite mathematics. I am guided by the belief that mathematics is a powerful tool that can help you make informed decisions in your personal and professional life.  ***Context before content*** is the guiding principle of this course pack. I will introduce you to the concepts in the context of real-world problems before diving into the mathematical details. This approach will help you understand the relevance of the mathematical concepts and motivate you to learn more.

Finite mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on discrete, quantifiable structures and concepts. Unlike the infinite expanses of calculus or the theoretical abstractions of abstract algebra, finite mathematics deals with concrete, countable elements. It finds its applications in various fields, from computer science and engineering to business and social sciences. This diversity is a testament to the fundamental role finite mathematics plays in modern problem-solving.

As you may have guessed, finite mathematics is a very broad area and it would be very hard to cover all concepts in a single book. This text covers three broad areas namely, functions, linear programming, and Mathematics of finance. The first two parts are helpful in creating mathematical models to solve real-life problems while the last part teaches you the nuances of personal finance with a heavy focus on understanding interest rates and how financial institutions leverage them to stay profitable. I believe that you will learn a lot of new material that you will find helpful in your life both as a student and as a responsible citizen. 

I created this course pack using markdown and executable code in quarto. In case you are curious and want to learn more about quarto, please visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
