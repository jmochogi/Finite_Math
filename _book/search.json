    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the world of finite mathematics! I have crafted this course pack to serve as your compass through the intriguing landscape of finite mathematics. I am guided by the belief that mathematics is a powerful tool that can help you make informed decisions in your personal and professional life. Context before content is the guiding principle of this course pack. I will introduce you to the concepts in the context of real-world problems before diving into the mathematical details. This approach will help you understand the relevance of the mathematical concepts and motivate you to learn more.\nFinite mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on discrete, quantifiable structures and concepts. Unlike the infinite expanses of calculus or the theoretical abstractions of abstract algebra, finite mathematics deals with concrete, countable elements. It finds its applications in various fields, from computer science and engineering to business and social sciences. This diversity is a testament to the fundamental role finite mathematics plays in modern problem-solving.\nAs you may have guessed, finite mathematics is a very broad area and it would be very hard to cover all concepts in a single book. This text covers three broad areas namely, functions, linear programming, and Mathematics of finance. The first two parts are helpful in creating mathematical models to solve real-life problems while the last part teaches you the nuances of personal finance with a heavy focus on understanding interest rates and how financial institutions leverage them to stay profitable. I believe that you will learn a lot of new material that you will find helpful in your life both as a student and as a responsible citizen.\nI created this course pack using markdown and executable code in quarto.

    "text": "1.1 Definitions and Notation for Linear Functions\nAs you hop into a taxicab in Allentown, the meter will immediately read $3.30; this is the “drop” charge made when the taximeter is activated. After that initial fee, the taximeter will add $2.40 for each mile the taxi drives. In this scenario, the total taxi fare depends upon the number of miles ridden in the taxi, and we can ask whether it is possible to model this type of scenario with a function. Using descriptive variables, we choose \\(m\\) for miles and \\(C\\) for Cost in dollars as a function of miles: \\(C(m)\\).\nHere, \\(C(0)\\) means the cost for travelling 0 miles (assuming you have entered the taxi). This cost is \\(\\$3.3\\). We can write this mathematically as\nSimilarly, \\(C(2)\\) is the cost of travelling 2 miles and can be computed as\nHere, we take the base charge of \\(\\$3.3\\) and add it to the charge for riding 2 miles to get a grand total of 8.1.\nIn general, if you travel \\(m\\) miles, the cost, \\(C(m)\\), can be computed as follows:\nIt is crucial to think carefully about the units of each component and how they relate. The expression below shows how this plays out in our taxi context:\n\\[C(m)=3.3 \\hspace{.1in} dollars + 2.4 \\hspace{.08in} \\frac{dollars}{mile} \\times m\\hspace{.1in} miles\\]\nWhen dollars per mile are multiplied by a number of miles, the result is a number of dollars, matching the units on the 3.30, and matching the desired units for the cost, \\(C(m)\\), of the ride (i.e., dollars).\nWe call a relationship such as this, a Function of \\(m\\). The above function takes \\(m\\) (the miles traveled) as the Input and returns \\(C(m)\\) (the cost of travelling \\(m\\) miles) as the Output. As you will learn shortly, this is an example of a Linear Function. There are many types of functions in mathematics and they are often named based on how the output values change in relation to changes in the input values. The function given above is called a *linear function because the output values change proportionately to the input values.",

    "text": "1.2 Anatomy of a Linear Function\nThere are two parts to the function above; the first part (3.3) is FIXED while the second part, \\(2.4m\\), VARIES depending on the value of \\(m\\). While the fixed part of the function is important in determining the cost, it is the second part that plays an important role if we wanted to understand how “fast” the cost changes (in this case increases). As we will see later, the value \\(2.4\\) is known as the Rate of Change for the function \\(C(m)\\). It tells us how fast, \\(C(m)\\) changes as we change \\(m\\). Furthermore, since this rate of change stays the same regardless of the value of \\(m\\), we say that the rate is Constant which means that the cost changes at a constant rate.\nIn summary, a linear function has the following structure, where \\(b\\) is the fixed part, and \\(mx\\) is the variable part.\n\\[f(x)=b+mx\\]\nThe higher the rate of change, the faster the output values change. For example, if we adjust the rate of change to 3.5 from 2.4 in the above scenario, you can expect the cost of riding to increase faster as you increase \\(m\\).",

Other tools for representing functions are tables and graphs.\nBelow is a table for the function above:\n\nQuestion: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a table instead of a formula or verbal description?\nWe can also represent the function above using a graph. See below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the cost is dependent on the miles traveled, we call it a Dependent Variable. We call the miles \\((m)\\) an Independent Variable. By convention, we place the dependent variable on the horizontal axis (x-axis) and the dependent variable on the vertical axis (y-axis).\nIf you ride 0 miles, the cost is $3.30, giving the coordinate \\((m, C(m))=(0, 3.30)\\) on the graph. We call this point, the vertical or \\(C(m)-intercept\\) (or \\(y-intercept\\) in a general graph using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)).\nWe call the above function, a Linear Function because its graph produces a straight line. This straight line results because the change in cost is consistent on any intervals of miles.\nIn a graph of any linear function, the rate of change is often referred to as Slope because it tells us how steep the line is. If the rate of change in the taxi scenario given above were, say, 5 dollars per mile, instead of 2.4, the line would be much steeper than it is. When a linear function is expressed in the form \\(f(x)=mx+b\\), we call it slope-intercept form. This form is the most common because it makes it easier to spot the \\(slope\\) and the \\(y-intercept\\) which are important characteristics of linear functions.",

As we have seen, it can tell you whether the function is increasing or decreasing and can be used to create the function formula (linear model) for a given real life situation. The question that arises is, “how can we compute the rate of change from given data (e.g., from a table?”. In the earlier taxi example, suppose, we did not know the rate of change but only knew the cost of riding 4 miles and 7 miles. How can we use this information together with the fact that the function is linear to find the rate of change and even the formula for the function?\nIn the next few examples we explore ways of finding the rate of change and how to use it to create the linear function/model for given real-life situations. At the end, a formula for computing the rate of change is provided.\nExample 1\nThe population of a city can be modeled approximately using a linear function. In 2002, the population was 23,400 and in 2006, it was 27,800.\nSolution\n\\[f(t) = 1100t+23,400\\]\nExample 2\nThe summit of Africa’s largest peak, Mt.

Let \\(P\\) be the population and \\(t\\) the time in years.\nAssuming the model (function) holds true until 2024, what would be the population of the town in 2024?\n\n\n\nSince we are told that the population grows linearly, we know that the growth between 2002 and 2003 is the same as the growth between 2003 and 2004, etc. Thus, to find the rate of change (i.e., population growth per year), we can divide the population change between 2002 and 2006 by the number of years as shown:\n\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Rate of change} &=  \\frac{\\text{pop. in 2006}- \\text{pop. in  2002}}{2006-2002}\\\\\\\\\n&= 1,100\\hspace{.04in} \\text{people per year}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\nIf we use 2002 as the base year(i.e., \\(t=0\\)), then the FIXED \\(y-intercept\\) value in the function is 23,400.

The y intercept means that the initial coverage at year zero (when the measurement was first taken) is \\(1951 m^2\\).\n\\(f(17)=(-55.57\\times17)+1951=1006.31\\); This means that there were \\(1006.31 mi^2\\) of ice coverage on Mt. Kilimanjaro by 2017 (i.e., 17 years after 2000).\nRemember that \\(A(t)\\) is the function that gives the ice coverage after \\(t\\) years. Therefore, if the ice cover is zero, it means \\(A(t)=0\\).

The supply function shows the relationship between the quantity of a product that producers have available and the price of the product. The demand curve shows the relationship between the quantity of a product that consumers are willing to buy and the price of the product. The point where the supply and demand functions intersect is called the equilibrium point. At this point, the quantity of the product that producers are willing to supply is equal to the quantity that consumers are willing to buy. Consider the following example:\nExample 1\nThe supply, in thousands of items, for custom phone cases can be modeled by the equation, \\(s(p)=0.5+1.2p\\) while the demand can be modeled by \\(d(p)=8.7−0.7p\\), where p is in the price in dollars. Find the equilibrium price and quantity.\nSolution\nThere are two ways to solve this problem. First, you can set up \\(s(p)=d(p)\\) then solve algebraically for \\(p\\) or simply graph the two functions then look at the point of intersection.\nLet us do both.\nGraphical solution :\nFor the graphical solution, you simply graph the two functions (you can use tools such as desmos or geogebra) and read out the coordinates of the intersection point.\nThe approximate point of intersection for the graphs is \\((4.3,5.6)\\). You can get more accurate values using technology. This intersection is a pair \\((x,y)\\) where the first number is the price (input) and the second if the quantity (output).\nAlgebraic solution:\nThus, the equilibrium price is approximately $4.32.\nTo find the quantity associated with this price, use any of the two functions to evaluate the output at \\(p=4.32\\). It does not matter which function you use because both of them have the same output value at the point of intersection (a shared point).\nThus, the two approaches give us the same solution.",

    "text": "3.2 Cost Analysis\nThe cost of manufacturing an item often consists of the fixed costs and the variable costs. Fixed costs are costs that do not change with the quantity of items produced while variable costs change with the quantity of items produced. Fixed costs may include setting up equipment, training workers, etc. The total cost of manufacturing \\(x\\) items can be modeled by a linear function of the form \\(C(x)=b+mx\\), where \\(b\\) is the fixed cost and \\(m\\) is the variable cost per item. The fixed cost is the cost incurred even when no items are produced while the variable cost is the cost incurred for each item produced.\nThe rate of change of the cost, \\(C\\), at a production level, \\(x\\), is equal to the slope of the cost function at the point \\(x\\). This rate of change is the cost of producing one more item at that production level. It is also called the marginal cost. In the context of linear functions, the marginal cost equals the slope of the cost function. Note that this may not be the same for a non-linear function.\nExample 2\nThe marginal cost of producing \\(x\\) phones is $350.5 per phone, while the cost of producing 100 phones is $49,150. Find the cost function, \\(C(x)\\), given that it is a linear function.\nSolution\nSince the function is linear, it can be represented as \\(C(x)=b+mx\\), where, \\(m\\) is the slope (marginal cost), and \\(b\\) is the fixed cost. We are given that the marginal cost is $350.5 per phone. This means that the slope of the function is 350.5. We can use the point-slope formula for linear functions (see section 2.3) as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  C(x)-49,150&=350.5(x-100) \\\\ \\\\\n  C(x)-49,150&=350.5x-35,050\\\\ \\\\\n  C(x)&=350.5x-35,050+49,150\\\\ \\\\\n  C(x)&=350.5x+14,100\\\\ \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the cost function is \\(C(x)=350.5x+14,100\\).\nExample 3\nThe fixed costs for a milk processing company are $10,000. Given that the total cost for producing 1,000 gallons of milk is $10,000, find the cost function, \\(C(x)\\) where \\(x\\) is the number of gallons produced. Assume that \\(C(x)\\) is a linear function. Find the cost of producing 100,000 gallons of milk.\nSolution\nLeft as an exercise for you to try.",

    "text": "3.3 Break-Even Analysis\nThe break-even point is the point at which the total revenue equals the total cost. It is the point at which the company neither makes a profit nor a loss. The break-even point can be found by setting the total revenue equal to the total cost and solving for the quantity produced. The total revenue is the product of the price of the item and the quantity produced. The total cost is the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs. The break-even point is the quantity produced at which the total revenue equals the total cost.\nCompanies use the break-even point to determine the minimum quantity of items they need to produce to cover their costs. If the company produces more than the break-even point, they make a profit. If they produce less than the break-even point, they make a loss. Companies can use the break-even point to make decisions about pricing, production levels, etc.\nExample 4\nA milk farmer finds that the total cost of producing milk in his farm is given by the function \\(C(x)=0.5x+1000\\), where \\(x\\) is the number of gallons of milk produced. The farmer sells each gallon of milk for $2.\n\nFind the total revenue function, \\(R(x)\\), in terms of \\(x\\).\nHow many gallons must the farmer sell to break-even?\nHow many gallons must the farmer sell to make a profit of $5,000?\n\nSolution\n\nThe revenue function is the product of the price of the item and the quantity produced. Thus, \\(R(x)=2x\\).\nWe find the break even quantity by setting \\(R(x)=C(x)\\) then solving for \\(x\\). This idea is captured under section 3.1 on intersecting lines.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  R(x)&=C(x)\\\\ \\\\\n  0.5x+1000&=2x\\\\ \\\\\n  0.5x-2x&=-1000\\\\ \\\\\n  -1.5x&=-1000\\\\ \\\\\n  x&=666.67\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe farmer must sell at 666.67 gallons to break even. To find the break-even revenue, we evaluate the revenue function at \\(x=666.67\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  R(666.67)&= 2\\times 666.67\\\\ \\\\\n  &=1333.34\\\\ \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nAlternatively, you can graph the two functions \\(C(x)\\) and \\(R(x)\\) and find the point of intersection in the graph. The point of intersection is the break-even point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to the point of intersection, the farmer is making a loss because the blue line (cost function) is higher than the red one (revenue function). After the point of intersection, the farmer is making a profit.\n\nTo make a profit of $5,000, the total revenue must exceed the total cost by $5,000. Thus, we set \\(R(x)=C(x)+5,000\\) then solve for \\(x\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  2x&=0.5x+6000\\\\ \\\\\n  2x-0.5x&=6000\\\\ \\\\\n  1.5x&=6000\\\\ \\\\\n  x&=4000\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe farmer must sell 4,000 gallons to make a profit of $5,000.",

They can include labor (human hours), farmland, machinery, etc. Resources, in general, are always limited and management must decide how to allocate them in order to get the maximum possible profit.\nLinear programming (LP) is one of the most important methods used in management science to solve problems of the kind describe above.

    "text": "4.2 Mixture Problems & Charts\nA mixture problem is a problem which includes combining limited resources to manufacture products that will generate maximum profit for the company. We use the term constraints to refer to the limitations that the company faces in making production decisions.\nThese problems are common because most products that we use involve combining multiple resources in their production.

    "section": "4.3 The Geometric Method",
    "text": "4.3 The Geometric Method\nThe geometric method of solving linear programming problems involves creating a graph to visualize the feasible region (the set of likely solutions) and then identifying the correct solution from the feasible region. Since the inequalities involve linear functions, the feasible region is polygonal in shape. The type of polygon formed (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, etc) depends on the number of constraints you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefitnition - Feasible Region\n\n\n\nA feasible region for a linear programming problem is the collection of all physical possible solution choices that can be made.\n\n\nLet us proceed with the solution to Example 1. The first step is to create a mixture chart (done in part a). Next, we will convert the problem into mathematical terms (inequalities and equations), and then create a feasible region. Finally, we use a technique called the corner point principle to choose the best solution from the feasible region.\n\n4.3.1 Converting Mixture Chart into Mathematical Form\nRecall that we use the variable, \\(x\\) for skateboards, and \\(y\\) for dolls. We know that we cannot manufacture negative number of objects (skateboards of dolls). So, negative numbers are not permitted in this context. Note, however, that 0 is a possible number. Thus, we have two inequalities;\n\\[x \\ge 0 \\hspace{.04in} \\text{and} \\hspace{.04in} y \\ge 0\\]\nThe symbol \\(&gt;\\) means grater than while \\(\\ge\\) means greater than or equal to.\nWe call the above two inequalities minimum constraints because they tell us the minimum that we can have for each product.\nSince we have a limited supply of resources (in this case only 60 units of plastic) we must also have inequalities for resource constraints. Since we need 5 units of plastic to manufacture ONE skateboard, we will need \\(5x\\) units to manufacture x units of skateboards. Similarly, we will need \\(2y\\) units of plastic to manufacture y dolls. In total, we need \\(5x+2y\\) units of plastic to manufacture the dolls and skateboard. This value must not exceed 60. Thus, we have the inequality,\n\\[5x+2y\\le60\\]\nNotice that this time, we use the symbol for less than or equal to.\nIn this problem, we only have 3 inequalities but in a realistic problem, there would be hundreds or even thousands of them.\nThe last step in formulating the mathematical model is to make the objective function. This is the function that connects the profit to the resources. Since we know that each skateboard results in $1.00 profit, we know that \\(x\\) dolls will result in a profit of \\(\\$1x\\) and \\(y\\) dolls will result in a profit of \\(\\$0.55x\\). We do not know what the profit is but we know it is a function of both dolls and skateboards. We can denote the profit as \\(P\\). So, we have the equation,\n\\[P=1x+0.55y\\] Notice that the objective function is an equation (not inequality) that gives a specific amount of profit as we vary the number of skateboards and dolls. In other words, \\(P\\) changes as we change \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So we can determine the value of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that would produce maximum profit.\n\n\n4.3.2 Visualizing the Feasible Region\nAfter creating the inequalities from the mixture chart, we can draw a picture to help us visualize the feasible region geometrically. Graphs are the most commonly used tools for visualizing the feasible region.\nNotice that all the three inequalities (i.e., the minimum and resource constraints) are linear in the sense that when you graph them (assuming an equal sign) you will get a straight line. To take care of the fact that the inequalities admit a broad range of values, we,\n\nUse a dotted line if the inequality is strictly less \\((&lt;)\\) or greater \\((&gt;)\\) and shade the region that does not represent the constraints. For example, if \\(y&gt;2\\), we draw a dotted line for \\(y=2\\) and shade the region containing points that do not obey this constraint.\nUse a bold line if the inequality allows equality.\n\nBelow is a graph of the feasible region for our problem above. We have shaded out the unwanted region so the feasible region (white space) is easy to see. Points in the feasible region (e.g., the green one) are possible solutions.\n\n\n\nFeasible Region\n\n\nAll points within the region labelled “feasible region” are possible solutions to our problem in the sense that they do not violate the constraints. For example, the feasible point \\((8,4)\\) requires the company to manufacture 8 skateboards and 4 dolls. This “solution” does not violate any of the constraints given in the problem. To find the profit associated with this point, we use the objective (profit) function to compute the profit as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP&=x+0.55y\\\\\n&=8+(0.55\\times 4)\\\\\n&=\\$10.20\n\\end{align}\\]\nNow, it is easy to show that there is a different point within the feasible region that would yield a higher profit while still obeying the constraints. Take, for example, the point \\((2,20)\\) which means 2 skateboards and 20 dolls. The profit for this choice would be higher. See below:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP&=1.00 x+0.55y\\\\\n&=2+(0.55\\times 20)\\\\\n&=\\$13.0\n\\end{align}\\]\nChoosing a point in the feasible region that would result in maximum profit (optimal production policy) is not a trivial task. However, there is a genius technique known as The Corner Point Principle which we discuss next.\n\n\n4.3.3 The Corner Point Principle\nThe corner point principle has been touted as one of the most important insights into the theory of linear programming. The principle states that,\n\n\nIn a linear programming problem, the maximum value for the profit formula always corresponds to a corner point of the feasible region.\n\n\nFor our feasible region above, there are three corners. These corners have coordinates \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,30\\), and \\((12,0)\\). So, we use the profit function, \\(P=x+.55y\\), to compute the profit associated with each of these 3 points and choose the highest as our optimal production policy. See the calculations below:\nFor \\((0,0)\\), the profit would be \\(P=1.00 (0)x+0.55(0)=\\$0.00\\)\nFor \\((0,30)\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (0)x+0.55(30)=\\$16.50\\)\nFor \\((12,0)\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (12)x+0.55(0)=\\$12.00\\)\nTherefore, the optimal production policy would be to manufacture 0 skateboards and 30 dolls.\nNOTE: In the real world, there would be a lot more corners which would make this process cumbersome. However, as mentioned earlier, there are computer programs that can do the job faster and more efficiently than humans.\n\n\n4.3.4 Summary of the Geometric Method\n\nRead the problem carefully to identify resources and products.\nMake a mixture chart for the problem.\nAssign an unknown quantities (often \\(x\\), and \\(y\\)) to each product and use the mixture chart to write the resource and minimum constraints.\nWrite the profit formula as well.\nCreate a feasible region by graphing ther inequalities (you can use a program such as Geogebra or Desmos).\nFind the coordinates of the corner points and evaluate the profit for each. The corner that gives maximum profit is the optimal production policy.\n\nIn the next example, we extend the toy problem above to include one more resource (person minutes). Read below:\nExample 2\nA toy manufacturer can manufacture only skateboards and, only dolls, or some kind of skateboards and dolls. Skateboards require 5 units of plastic and can be sold for a profit of $ 1, while dolls require 2 units of plastic and can be sold for $0.55 profit. Only 60 units of plastic are available. Furthermore, making one skateboard requires 15 person-minutes while making one doll requires 18-person minutes. There are only 360 person-minutes available.\n\nMake a mixture chart to model this situation.\nWhat numbers of skateboards and/or dolls should the company make to maximize profit?\n\nSolution\n\nBelow is the new mixture chart,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\nResource 1: Plastic: 60\nResource 2: person-minutes  360\nProfit\n\n\n\n\nSkateboard  (x units)\n5\n15\n$ 1.00\n\n\nDolls(y units)\n2\n18\n$ 0.55\n\n\n\n\nWe start by writing down the inequalities (constraints) and the profit function. We still have the same minimum constraints as from example 1: \\[x \\ge 0 \\hspace{.04in} \\text{and} \\hspace{.04in} y \\ge 0\\] For the resource constraints, we have two inequalities because we have two resources: For the plastic, we have \\[5x+2y\\le60\\]  For the person hours, we have, \\[15x + 18y \\le 360\\]  The profit function stays the same: \\[P=1x+0.55y\\]  Next, we create a feasible region by graphing the inequalities. Notice that this new feasible region is smaller than the first and it has four corner points. The fourth point is as a result of the new inequality created by the additional resource constraints. As indicated earlier, the more resources you have, the more the corner points you expect.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Feasible Region\n\n\nThe last step is to use the corner principle to find the optimal production policy: We check the profits for each of the corner:\nFor \\((0,0)\\), the profit would be \\(\\$0\\).\nFor \\((0,20\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (0)x+0.55(20)=\\$11.00\\)\nFor \\((6,15\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (6)x+0.55(15)=\\$14.50\\)\nFor \\((12,0\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (12)x+0.55(0)=\\$12.00\\)\nThus, in this new problem, the optimal production policy is 6 skateboards and 15 dolls for a maximum profit of $ 14.50.",

The company has 100 lb of scrap cloth and 120 lb of scrap paper on hand. A batch of grade A paper brings a profit of $500, whereas a batch of grade B paper brings a profit of $250.

    "text": "5.1 Introduction to Simplex Method\nAs stated earlier, Linear Programming is one of the most commonly used methods for solving practical problems in business and even in government. However, the problems we have considered so far had a maximum of two products and relatively small feasible regions and few corner points. Many real life problems often involve much more products and result in very big feasible regions with hundreds or even thousands of corner points.\nThe simplex method provides a more general method of solving LP programs without relying on a physical feasible region. Consider the following LP problem through which we will discuss the details of the simplex method:\nExample 1\nA factory manufactures chairs, tables and bookcases each requiring the use of three operations: Cutting, Assembly, and Finishing. The first operation can be used at most 600 hours; the second at most 500 hours; and the third at most 300 hours. A chair requires 1 hour of cutting, 1 hour of assembly, and 1 hour of finishing; a table needs 1 hour of cutting, 2 hours of assembly, and 1 hour of finishing; and a bookcase requires 3 hours of cutting, 1 hour of assembly, and 1 hour of finishing. If the profit is $20 per unit for a chair, $30 for a table, and $25 for a bookcase, how many units of each should be manufactured to maximize profit?\nLet us start by creating a mixture chart for the problem:\nNext, we make the constraint inequalities assuming that the company makes \\(x\\) chairs, \\(y\\) tables, and \\(z\\) bookcases. Note that using \\(x,y\\), and \\(z\\) is not advisable when you have more than 3 variables. It is recommended you use \\(x_1, x_2, x_3,...\\)\nMinimum constraints: Chairs: \\(x\\ge 0\\) Tables: \\(y\\ge 0\\) Bookcases: \\(z\\ge 0\\).\nResource constraints:  For cutting: \\(x+y+3z\\le600\\) For assembly: \\(x+2y+z\\le500\\) For finishing: \\(x+y+z\\le300\\)\nThings to Note\nYou should try this problem on your own (see exercises) once you have understood the simplex method. For now, the step-by-step procedure of the simplex algorithm is presented.",

    "text": "5.2 Step-by-Step Simplex Method\nWe want to walk through the simplex method step-by-step until we find an optimal production policy and the maximum profit.\nConsider the example below:\nExample 2\nMaximize the function \\(P=3x+4y+z\\) subject to the conditions\n\\[3x+10y+5z \\le 120 \\] \\[5x+2y+8z \\le 6\\] \\[8x+10y+3z \\le 105\\]\nProblem Posing: Note that this problem does not have a real world context, before you proceed, please write a real life LP problem that might suit the given profit function and constraints.\nStep 1: Convert the inequalities to equations by adding slack variables and rewrite the profit function so that the constant value is on the right hand side of the equation: \\[3x+10y+5z+s_1 = 120 \\] \\[5x+2y+8z +s_2= 6\\] \\[8x+10y+3z +s_3= 105\\] \\[-3x-4y-z+P\\] Slacks allow us to convert inequalities to equations by filling up the amount by which a quantity falls short of another. For example, \\(s_1\\) is the amount by which the quantity \\(3x+10y+5z\\) falls short of 120. So, by adding \\(s_1\\) to \\(3x+10y+5z\\) we achieve the equality. sh\nStep 2: Create the initial simplex tableau. In the tableu, each equation appears in its own row with the profit function appearing as the last row. See table below:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc|c}\nx & y & z & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & P & Cnst \\\\\n    \\hline\n    3 & 10 & 5 & 1 & 0 & 0&0 &120 \\\\\n    5 & 2 & 8 & 0 & 1 & 0&0 & 6\\\\\n    8 & 10 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1&0 & 105\\\\\n    \\hline\n    -3 & -4 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nStep 3: Choose the pivot column. The most negative entry in the last row is -4 which is in column 2. So, column 2 is our pivot column. See below:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc|c}\nx & y & z & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & P & Cnst \\\\\n    \\hline\n    3 & \\color{red} 10 & 5 & 1 & 0 & 0&0 &120 \\\\\n    5 &  \\color{red} 2 & 8 & 0 & 1 & 0&0 & 6\\\\\n    8 &  \\color{red} 10 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1&0 & 105\\\\\n    \\hline\n    -3 &  \\color{red}-4 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhy do we choose the most negative element in the last row? \nThe most negative entry in the bottom row represents the largest coefficient in the objective function - the coefficient whose entry will increase the value of the objective function the quickest. Remember this is a maximization problem.\nStep 4: Find the pivot row. To find the pivot row, divide the values on the far right by values of the pivot column. The row with the smallest quotient will be your pivot row. In this case, \\[120/10=12\\] \\[6/2=3\\] \\[105/110=10.5\\] The smallest quotient here is 3, which means the pivot row is row 2. The matrix below highlight the pivot row:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc|c}\nx & y & z & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & P & Cnst \\\\\n    \\hline\n    3 & \\color{red} 10 & 5 & 1 & 0 & 0&0 &120 \\\\\n    \\color{red} 5 & \\color{red} \\color{red} 2 & \\color{red} 8 & \\color{red} 0 & \\color{red} 1 & \\color{red} 0& \\color{red} 0 & \\color{red} 6\\\\\n    8 & \\color{red} 10 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1&0 & 105\\\\\n    \\hline\n    -3 & \\color{red} -4 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhy does the smallest quotient identify a row?  Using the quotients to identify the pivot element guarantees that we do not violate the constraints as we proceed with the algorithm.\nStep 5: The 2 at the intersection of row 2 and column 2 is called a pivot element. We want to perform row operations to make it a 1. To do this, we simply divide the whole of row 2 by 2. This can be represented as \\(\\frac{1}{2}R_2 \\mapsto R_2\\). This means that the new row 2 will be half of the previous row 2.\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\times(5,2,8,0,1,0,0,6)=(2.5,1,4,0,.5,0,0,3)\\)\nThe new tableau becomes,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc|c}\nx & y & z & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & P & Cnst \\\\\n    \\hline\n    3 & 10 & 5 & 1 & 0 & 0&0 &120 \\\\\n    \\color{red} 2.5 & \\color{red}1 & \\color{red}4 & \\color{red}0 & \\color{red}0.5 & \\color{red}0 & \\color{red}0 & \\color{red}3\\\\\n    8 & 10 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1&0 & 105\\\\\n    \\hline\n    -3 & -4 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nStep 6: We perform row operations to convert every entry above and below the new pivot element (1) into a 0. The following operations will achieve this:\n\nThe new row 1 will be the difference between row and and 10 times row 2 i.e., \\(R_1 - 10R_2\\mapsto R_1\\).\nThe new row 3 will be the difference between the current row 3 and 10 times row 2.e., \\(R_3 - 10R_2\\mapsto R_3\\).\nThe new row 4 will be the current row 4 plus 4 times row 2 i.e., \\(R_4 + 4R_2\\mapsto R_4\\).\n\nWe perform the actual computations below:\n\\(R_1 - 10R_2\\mapsto R_1\\):  \\((3,10,5,1,0,0,0,120) - 10(2.5,1,4,0,0.5,0,0,3)=(-22,0,-35,1,-5,0,0,90)\\).\n\\(R_3 - 10R_2\\mapsto R_3\\):  \\((8,10,3,0,0,1,0,105) - 10(2.5,1,4,0,0.5,0,0,3)=(17,0,-37,0,-5,1,0,75)\\).\n\\(R_4 + 4R_2\\mapsto R_4\\):  \\((-3,-4,-1,0,0,0,1,0) + 4(2.5,1,4,0,0.5,0,0,3)=(7,0,15,0,2,0,1,12)\\).\nNow we put these new rows into our tableau. See below:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccccc|c}\nx & y & z & s_1 & s_2 & s_3 & P & Cnst \\\\\n    \\hline\n    -22 & 0 & -35 & 1 & -5 & 0 & 0 & 90 \\\\\n    2.5 & 1 & 4 & 0 & 0.5 & 0 & 0 & 3\\\\\n    -17 & 0 & -37 & 0 & -5 & 1 & 0 & 75\\\\\n    \\hline\n    7 & 0 & 15 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 12\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNotice that the last row has no negative numbers. This means we are done and we can directly read our solution. If there were any negative numbers left on the last row, you would have to do the process one more time (i.e., find new pivot column and row then perform subsequent row operations). This process continues until there are no negative numbers on the last row.\nStep 7:  Read the solution from the final tableau. Every column with a “1’s” and “0’s” would give us a value for a variable. In our case above,\n\\(y=3, s_1=90, s_3=75, P=12\\)\nAll the others (i.e., \\((x,z,s_2)\\)) will be zero.\nThis solution basically means, make 3 units of product \\(y\\), and zero product \\(x\\) and \\(z\\).\n\n5.2.1 Summary of the Simplex Method\nBelow is a summary of the simplex method for maximization problems in LP:\n\nSet up the problem. That is, convert the problem into mathematical terms. This involves creating the constraint inequalities and the objective function.\nConvert the inequalities into equations. This is done by adding one slack variable for each inequality.\nConstruct the initial simplex tableau with the objective function as the bottom row. d)Identify the pivot column. The most negative entry in the bottom row identifies the pivot column.\nCalculate the quotients. The smallest quotient identifies a row. The element in the intersection of the column identified in step 4 and the row identified in this step is identified as the pivot element. The quotients are computed by dividing the far right column by the identified column in step 4. A quotient that is a zero, or a negative number, or that has a zero in the denominator, is ignored.\nPerform pivoting to make all other entries in this column zero.\nWhen there are no more negative entries in the bottom row, we are finished; otherwise, we start again from step (d).\nRead off your answers. Get the variables using the columns with 1 and 0s. All other variables are zero. The maximum value you are looking for appears in the bottom right hand corner.",

    "text": "5.3 A Short Trip Back\nLet us use the simplex method to solve example 2 from the previous chapter. For your convenience the example is repeated below:\nExample 3\nA toy manufacturer can manufacture only skateboards and, only dolls, or some kind of skateboards and dolls. Skateboards require 5 units of plastic and can be sold for a profit of $1.00, while dolls require 2 units of plastic and can be sold for $0.55 profit. Only 60 units of plastic are available. Furthermore, making one skateboard requires 15 person-minutes while making one doll requires 18-person minutes. There are only 360person person-minutes available.\nSolution\nRecall that we had generated the following resource inequalities:\n\\(5x+2y\\le 60\\)\n\\(15x+18y\\le360\\) (Simplifies to \\(5x+6y\\le120\\) by dividing through by 3)\nWe also had the following profit function: \\(P=1.00x+0.55y\\)\nOur first step is to convert the inequalities to equations by adding slack variables and rewriting the profit function:\n\\(5x+2y+s_1= 60\\)\n\\(5x+6y+s_2=120\\)\n\\(-1x-0.55y+P=0\\)\nThus, our initial tableau on which we shall perform row operations is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 &  60 \\\\\n5 & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 120\\\\\n\\hline\n-1 & -0.55 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext, we find the pivot element by identifying the pivot column and row.\nThe most negative entry in the last row is \\(-1\\) and so the first column is our pivot column:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}5 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 &  60 \\\\\n\\color{red}5 & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 120\\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}-1 & -0.55 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo find the pivot row, we compute following quotients : \\(\\frac{60}{5}=12\\); \\(\\frac{360}{5}=72\\). Thus, our pivot row is row 1.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}\\textbf5 & \\color{red}2 & \\color{red}1 & \\color{red}0 & \\color{red}0 & \\color{red}60 \\\\\n\\color{red}{5} & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 &  120\\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}-1 & -0.55 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nOur pivot element is, therefore, the \\(5\\) in the first row. Next perform row operations to make the element a \\(1\\). The operation to achieve this goal is \\(\\frac{1}{5}R_2\\) (i.e., we multiply the entire row 2 by one fifth). The new tableau becomes,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}\\textbf{1} & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 12\\\\\n5 & 6 & 0 & 1 & 0 &  120\\\\\n\\hline\n-1 & -0.55 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext, we perform row operations that will convert all entries of column 1 (except our pivot element) to 0. Let us start by targeting the 5. The operation \\(R_2-5R_1 \\mapsto R_2\\) (replace row 1 by row 2 minus five times row 1) will achieve our desired goals. See the new tableau below:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}\\textbf{1} & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 12\\\\\n\\color{red}\\textbf{0} & 4 & -5 & 1 & 0 & 60\\\\\n\\hline\n-1 & -0.55 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext, we perform the operation \\(R_3+R_1 \\mapsto R_3\\), which achieve the goal of converting the \\(-1\\) on the last row into a zero. Here is the new tableau:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}\\textbf{1} & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 12\\\\\n\\color{red}\\textbf{0} & 4 & -5 & 1 & 0 &  60\\\\\n\\hline\n\\color{red}\\textbf{0} & -0.15 & 0.2 & 0 & 1 & 12\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSince the last row still have a negative entry (i.e., \\(-1\\)), we repeat the process one more time:\nOur new pivot column is column 2 and the pivot row is row 2 (you should verify this). Thus, our pivot element is the 4 in row 2.\nTo convert the 4 into a 1, we perform the operation \\(\\frac{1}{4}R_2\\) (i.e., multiply the entire row by one fourth). Here is the new tableau:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 12\\\\\n0 & \\color{red}\\textbf{1} & -1.25 & 0.25 & 0 & 15\\\\\n\\hline\n0 & -0.15 & 0.2 & 0 & 1 & 12\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext, we convert the - 0.15 into 0 by performing the operation \\(R_3+0.15R_2\\mapsto R_3\\). The new tableau becomes,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 0.4 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 & 12\\\\\n0 & \\color{red}\\textbf{1} & -1.25 & 0.25 & 0 & 15\\\\\n\\hline\n0 & \\color{red}\\textbf{0} & 0.0125 & 0.0375 & 1 & 14.25\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nFinally, we convert the 0.4 into a 0 by performing the operation \\(R_1-0.4R_2\\mapsto R_1\\). The new tableau becomes:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc|c}\nx & y & s_1&s_2&P & Cnst \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & \\color{red}\\textbf{0} & 0.7 & 0.1 & 0 & 6\\\\\n0 & \\color{red}\\textbf{1} & -1.25 & 0.25 & 0 &  15\\\\\n\\hline\n0 & \\color{red}\\textbf{0} & 0.0125 & 0.0375 & 1 & 14.25\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNotice now that there is no negative entry on the last row. You can now read off the solutions from the columns with 1’s and 0’s.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx&=6\\\\\ny&=15\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhich means that the optimal production policy will be manufacturing 6 skateboards and 15 dolls. The maximum profit will be: \\[P=1.00(6)+0.55(15)=\\$14.25\\]\nThe profit can also be read off directly from the tableau above since the P column has only 0’s and 1’s.\nThe above solution is exactly the as the one obtained using the geometric method in the previous chapter.",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nConsider the following scenarios:\nScenario 1: After a long weekend holiday in your city, a scooter company has extra scooters in some part of the city and too few in others. The company is faced with the problem of reshuffling the scooters at a minimal cost so that each part of the city has the right number for their clients.\nScenario 2: A college has many campuses in a given state and materials (such as books) are often shared among the campuses. Because the calendars for each campus differs slightly, there are more resources in some campuses than others at some given point. The college needs to transport the resources between campuses to ensure student needs at each campus are met while keeping the transportation cost as low as possible.\nScenario 3: A huge car manufacturer has three manufacturing plants and several sales outlets at various locations in the country. Each outlet needs a specific number of cars. The cost of transporting the cars from different plants to different sales outlets is known. How should the company transport the cars while inuring minimum cost?\nDefinitions\nProblems of the kind given in the three scenarios above are called Transportation problems. Companies often face such kind of problems on a day to day basis. Transportation problems (TPs) are a special type of linear programming problems where the goal is to minimize cost of transporting goods/services from a number of sources/origins (such as manufacturing plants) to a number of destinations/outlets (such as stores).\nWe will solve problems for which the rim conditions are satisfied. There are methods for solving conditions where the rim conditions are not satisfied but those are beyond the scope of the course.\nExample 1 (Adopted from COMAP, 10th edition)\nImagine that we have three bakeries (I, II, and III) and three stores (1, 2, and 3), though the ideas that we develop will solve problems where the number of of stores and bakeries are not the same. The three stores require 3 dozen, 7 doze, and 1 dozen loaves of bread, respectively, while the three bakeries can supply 8 dozen, 1 dozen, and 2 dozen loaves, respectively. The shipping costs from bakery I to store 1, 2, and 3 are $8, $9, and $3 respectively. The the shipping costs from bakery II to stores 1, 2, and 3 are $15, $1, and $12 respectively. Finally, the shipping cost from bakery III to stores 1, 2, and 3 are $1, $3, and $5 respectively.\nSolution\nHere are important things to note about this new tablea:\nThus, the above shipment plan is feasible. The cost associated with the plan is \\[\\begin{align}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost&= 2(8)+6(9)+1(15)+1(3)+1(5)\\\\\n&=16+54+15+3+5\\\\\n&=93\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn case you are wondering how we came up with the above shipment plan, it means you are paying close attention. That is a good thing. The next section presents a method know as Northwest corner rule that we can use to find a feasible solution. the method does not use the associated costs and so may not guarantee an optimal solution.",

    "text": "Supply: This refers to the maximum number of products that can be shipped from the sources. Different sources may supply different amounts of a product.\nDemand: this refers to the minimum number of products that the destinations/outlets require. Again, different outlet often have different demands.\nRim conditions: We use the term rim conditions to refer to this situation where a specific number can be supplied from different sources and a specific number is required at different destinations. The rim conditions are satisfied when all units that can be supplied have been supplied and all demand requirements for each outlet have been met.\nTP Tableau: A transportation problem tableau is a table showing the sources, supply quantities for each source, destinations, demands for each destination, and the costs for shipping between each source and destination. The more units you ship the higher the cost.\nFeasible solution: A solution for a transportation problem that does not violate the rim conditions. In other words, all units are supplied out and all stores’ demands are met.\nOptimal Solution: A feasible solution that guarantees the minimum cost of transportation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a tableau to show the costs and rim conditions for the problem.\nFind a feasible solution (shipment plan) for this transportation cost. Is this solution optimal?\n\n\n\nBelow is the tableau showing the rims conditions and the costs.  The supply available is shown on the right side (8,1, and 2) while the demand is shown on the bottom side (3, 7, and 1) of the tableau. The supply adds up to 11 and so does the demand. Thus, the rim conditions are satisfied.  Each square on the tableau is called a cell and it shows the transportation cost. For example, the transportation cost from bakery I to store 2 is 9 units. We reference this cell as \\((I,2)\\). Similarly, in cell \\((III,2)\\) we see that the cost of transporting a dozen of bread from bakery III to store 2 is 5 units.\nBefore you learn about an algorithm that guarantees an optimal solution, let us look at one possible solution (feasible solution). Take a look at the tableau below:\n\n\n\nWe have new numbers (circled) added in different cells of the tableau. These numbers show the amount that we plan to ship. For example, the circled 6 in cell \\((I,2)\\) means we plan to ship 6 units from bakery I to store 2.\nWhen you add the circled numbers across rows, you get the number of supply for that bakery For example, the sum of the numbers in row 1 (bakery I) is \\(2+6=8\\) which equals the supply that can come from store I.\nWhen you add the circled numbers along columns, you get the number demanded by that store. For example, the sum of the circled numbers in column 3 is \\(6+1=7\\) which equals the demand for store 2.\nThere are only 5 circled numbers and the table has 3 columns and 3 rows for a total of - This will always be true for any feasible solution.\nAny feasible solution for a tableau with m rows and n columns will ship \nthrough (m+n)-1 cells.",

    "section": "6.2 The Northwest Corner Rule",
    "text": "6.2 The Northwest Corner Rule\nThe northwest corner rule (NWCR) leverages the geometry of the table to identify a feasible shipment plan. It works by reducing the initial tableau step by step until one cell remains. Below are the steps of the rule:\n\nOn the initial tableau, locate the cell that is as far to the top and to the left as possible (northwest). Ship via this cell the smaller of the two rim values (call this \\(s\\)) associated with the row and column of the cell. Put a circled entry (the \\(s\\)) in this cell to indicate that it is in use.\nCross out the column or row that had the value \\(s\\) and reduce the other rim value by \\(s\\).\nWhen a single cell remains, there will be a tie for the rim conditions of both the row and the column involved, and this amount is entered into the cell and circled.\n\nExample 2\nUse the northwest corner rule to find a feasible solution for the tableau in example 1 above.\nSolution\nFirst, recall that the NWCR ignores the costs. So, we first rewrite the tableau without the costs. We have also removed the tableau labels for simplicity, \nHere is an explanation of every step:\n\nStep 1: Locate the northwest corner cell on the initial tableau and ship 3 units through it. We choose 3 because it is the less of 3 and 8. We erase column 1 and reduce the 8 by 3.\nStep 2: For our new tableau (without column 1), we ship 5 units through the northwest cell. Delete the row and subtract 5 from 7 to get 2.\nStep 3: Ship one unit through the cell shown and subtract the 1 from 2. Delete the row.\nstep 4: Ship 1 unit through the northwest cell and erase the column. Reduce the row value by 1 to get 1. Now you are left with only one cell through which you ship 1 unit. You are done!\nstep 5: Rebuild the tables with the shipments above.\n\nObserve that there are exactly 5 cells through which we are shipping. This is one less than 6, which is the total number of rows and columns.\nThe cost of this new shipment plan is,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost&= 3(8)+5(9)+1(1)+1(3)+1(5)\\\\\n&=24+45+1+3+5\\\\\n&=78\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Notice that this cost is smaller than what we had earlier (93). The question that still remains is,\nIs this the cheapest solution? How can we be absolutely sure about this?\nIt turns out that this is still not the cheapest. There is an algorithm called the Stepping Stone Method that will guarantee an optimal solution (i.e., the cheapest shipment plan).",

    "section": "6.3 The Stepping Stone Method",
    "text": "6.3 The Stepping Stone Method\nBefore we look at the stepping stone method, we define the term indicator value.\nDefinition:\nThe indicator values of a cell, \\(C\\), not currently circled, is the cost change associated with increasing or decreasing the amounts shipped in a circuit of cells starting at cell \\(C\\). It is computed by summing with alternating signs the cost of the cells in the circuit.\nExample 3\nSince our ultimate goal is to improve the solution in the previous example, we are going to use the final tableau earlier (left side of figure below) to compute the indicator value. Suppose we want the indicator value for cell \\((I, 3)\\). Notice that this cell is currently not circled.\n\n\n\nFirst tableau\n\n\nNotice that the circuit has alternating \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) signs. We can ship \\(1\\) unit through cell \\((I,3)\\) and then reduce the amount being shipped in cell \\((III,3)\\) by \\(1\\). This means we reduce the amount in cell \\((I,2)\\) by \\(1\\) and then increase the amount being shipped in cell \\((III,2)\\) by \\(1\\) unit. Doing this does not affect the rim conditions (look at the new tableau).\nBy using this alternative tableau, we get a cost of \\(70\\). See below:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost&= 3(8)+4(9)+1(1)+2(3)+1(3)\\\\\n&=24+36+1+6+3\\\\\n&=70\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The difference in cost between this new tableau and the original one is \\(-8\\). Thus, the indicator value of this cell is \\(-8\\).\nAlternatively, we can compute the indicator values directly from the circuit as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nIndicator \\hspace{.05in}Value&= 1(3)-1(9)+1(3)-1(5)\\\\\n&=3-9+3-5\\\\\n&=-8\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We use 1 unit for each cell cost because that is the amount we are moving around thr circuit.\nSome things to Note;\n\nExample 3 above shows that by moving things around via the indicator value, we can save on the transportation cost.\nThe maximum amount you can move around is capped on the amount that can be shipped via a given cell. In our example above, we moved only 1 because that is the maximum that can be shipped via cell \\((I,3)\\). If you move 2 for example, you will violate the rim conditions.\nThe indicator value of a cell tells you the amount by which the cost decreases or increases if you ship via that cell.\nYou start with an empty cell but all the other three cells in the circuit must have some shipment already.\nIn some cases, we can ship 0 quantities through a cell.\n\nNow, we need to compute the indicator values for the rest of the cells.\nIndicator value computation for cell \\((II,3)\\) is shown below: \n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nIndicator \\hspace{.05in}Value&= 1(12)-1(1)+1(3)-1(5)\\\\\n&=12-1+3-5\\\\\n&=+9\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The positive indicator value means that shipping through that cell adds the cost. So, this does not help.\nNotice that the indicator values for the other two cells based on our initial tableau are also positive. So, our best tableau at the moment is the second figure in example 3 above. We ask ourselves, can we improve this tableau any further? It turns out that the only cell with negative indicator value based this new tableau is \\((III, 1)\\). See figure below:\n Notice that we moved 2 units around this time.\nWith this new tableau, all the empty cells have positive indicator values and so we cannot improve any further. We now have an optimal shipping plan. The cost of the plan is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost&= 1(8)+6(9)+1(3)+1(1)+2(1)\\\\\n&=8+54+3+1+2\\\\\n&=68\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The above process is called the stepping stone method. You check indicator values at every step until all cells have positive indicators values, which means the solution cannot be improved any further.\nExample 4 (Adopted from For All Practical Purposes, 10th Edition)\nTwo dairies supply three supermarket chains with the demands for sour cream as shown in the tableau below. Also indicated in the cells is the cost of shipping between pairs of sites.\n\na) Use the Northwest Corner Rule to obtain a feasible solution, and compute the cost of this feasible solution.\nb) If the feasible solution in part (a) is not optimal, find an optimal solution.\nSolution\nApplying the northwest corner rule, we get the following tableau: \na) Note that the rim conditions are satisfied. The solution for this shipping plan would be \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCost&=2(6)+3(9)+2(3)+4(5)\\\\\n&= 12+27+6+20\\\\\n&=65\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] b) To determine whether the solution in (a) is optimal, we compute the indicator values for each of the empty cells:\nFor cell \\((II,1)\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nIndicator \\hspace{.05in}Value\n&=+1-6+3-5\\\\\n&=-7\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor cell \\((II,2)\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nIndicator \\hspace{.05in}Value\n&=+7-5+3-9\\\\\n&=-4\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The negative indicator values mean that the solution we have is not optimal. We can improve it.\nLet us ship via \\((II,1)\\). The new tableau for this plan is, \nAnd the associated cost is,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost\n&=2(1)+2(5)+5(3)+3(9)\\\\\n&=51\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Although this is an improved solution, the indicator value for cell \\((II,2)\\) is negative \\((7-5+3-9=-4)\\), which means we can do better.\nLet us improve this by shipping via cell \\((II,2)\\). The new tableau becomes, \nNotice that with this new tableau, all empty cells have positive indicator values. Hence, this is the best shipment plan that we can get and thus is the optimal solution.\nThe cost associated with this plan is,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nShipment \\hspace{.05in}Cost\n&=2(1)+2(7)+6(3)+1(9)\\\\\n&=43\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

In the above game, both Tracy and Steve have identical strategies (i.e., split and steal”). The payoff is at the intersection of the row (Tracy’s strategies) and the column (Steve’s strategies) chosen by each players.

    "text": "7.3 Payoff Matrix\nWe are going to consider a “simpler” game in order to develop the concept of a payoff matrix even further: In a penalty shoot out game, there are two players, the kicker and the goalie. The kicker can kick left, right, or straight (center) while the goalie can dive left, right, or stay at the center. If the kicker scores, the goalie pays $10. Otherwise, the kicker pays the goalie $10. We are going to assume that a goal is scored only if the direction of the kick and the goalie’s dive are not the same. For example, a right kick and a left dive result in a goal, in which case the goalie pays $10 to the kicker. The following is the payoff matrix for the penalty shoot out game:\n\n\n\n\nDive Left\nDive Center\nDive Right\n\n\n\n\nKick Left\n0, 10\n10, 0\n10, 0\n\n\nKick Center\n10, 0\n0, 10\n10, 0\n\n\nKick Right\n10, 0\n10, 0\n0, 10\n\n\n\nThings to note:\n\nThe rows represent the kicker’s strategies while the columns represent the goalie’s strategies. This is a \\(3\\times3\\) (read as “three by three”) matrix because there are three strategies for each player.\nThe first number in each cell represents the payoff to the kicker, while the second number represents the payoff to the goalie. For example, if the kicker kicks left and the goalie dives left, the kicker gets 0 and the goalie gets 10 (from the kicker).\nThe above game is two-person zero-sum game because the sum of the payoffs to the kicker and the goalie is always zero. This is because the money is transferred from one player to the other (no money comes from outside).\n\n\n7.3.1 Simplified Notation\nAlthough the table above representing the payoffs is fairly easy way to grasp, it is often better to represent the information in a manner that shows a single number for each “cell” such that a negative number represents a loss while a positive number represents a gain. As a standard, we use rows as the stand point such that the entry \\((10,0)\\) is written as \\(10\\) because the kicker gains $10. Similarly, the entry \\(0,10)\\) is written as \\(-10\\) because the kicker loses $10. Furthermore, we can now drop the column and row labels. Note that all this is based on the perspective of the kicker (the rows). The following is the simplified payoff matrix for the penalty shoot out game:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-10 & \\phantom{-}10 & \\phantom{-}10 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}10 & -10 & \\phantom{-}10  \\\\\n\\phantom{-}10 & \\phantom{-}10 & -10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n7.3.2 Dominated Strategies\nIn the penalty shoot out game described above, if the kicker deploys the first strategy (i.e., kick left), then, the only way he can get a $10-dollar payoff is if the goalie dives right or center. For the kicker, the second and third strategies (center and right kicks) are just as good as the first. A similar argument can be made for the goalie.\nA strategy is said to be dominated if there is another strategy that always gives a higher payoff, regardless of the other player’s strategy. In the penalty shootout game above, there is no dominated strategy for either player.\nNow, suppose there are certain left kicks (maybe left top corner) for which the kicker will always score even if the goalie dives left. In this case, the payoff matrix will be as follows:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n10 & \\phantom{-}10 & \\phantom{-}10 \\\\\n10 & -10 & \\phantom{-}10  \\\\\n10 & \\phantom{-}10 & -10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nIn this case, if the kicker uses the first strategy (left kick), he will always get a $10 payoff regardless of what strategy the goalie deploys. This is the only strategy that would guarantee a $ 10 payoff to the kicker. We call such a strategy a dominant strategy because it always gives the highest payoff, regardless of the other player’s strategy. For the kicker, the other two strategies are dominated strategies. These are “row 2” and “row 3” in the payoff matrix above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Dominated Strategy\n\n\n\nA given row (say row A) for the first player dominates another row (say row B) if every entry in row A is larger than the corresponding entry in row B. In this case, we call row B a dominated strategy.\nFor the second player (columns), a given column is dominant if every entry is smaller than the corresponding entry in another column.\n\n\nEither player can have dominated strategies. Make sure to keep a track of the strategies that are dominated and the ones that are dominant. Since dominated strategies are never the best choice, we often eliminate them from the game.\nExample 1:\nFor each of the following payoff matrices, describe the payoffs for each player then find any dominated strategies. Also, write down the final game by removing the dominated strategies.\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n-9 & -5 & -7 & -10\\\\\n-2 & \\phantom{-}1 & -8 & \\phantom{-}13 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n5 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 9 \\\\\n6 & 7\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSolution:\n\nThis is a two-player \\(2\\times4\\) game. The first player has two strategies while the second player has four strategies. The entry at the intersection of the second row and the second column represents a payoff of one unit to the first player. This is the only positive entry in the payoff matrix. All other entries (negatives) represent payoffs to the second player. Column 2 is a dominated strategy since every entry in column 3 is smaller than every entry in column 2. Similar, column 1 dominates column 2. We can eliminate this strategy (column 2) from the game. The final game is as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-9 & -7 & -10\\\\\n-2 & -8 & \\phantom{-}13 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThis is a two-player \\(3\\times2\\) game. The first player has three strategies while the second player has two. The zero entry means that there is no payoff for either player when the first player uses the second strategy and the second uses the first.\n\nEach entry in row 3 is larger than the corresponding entry in row 1. This means that the first row is a dominated strategy. We can eliminate this strategy from the game. The final game is as follows:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n5 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 9 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]",

    "text": "7.4 Strictly Determined Games\nConsider the following payoff matrix for a two-player game:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-8 & -9 & \\phantom{-}8\\\\\n\\phantom{-}2 & \\phantom{-}5 & \\phantom{-}6 \\\\\n-1& \\phantom{-}7 & -2\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nRecall that positive numbers in the matrix mean payoffs to the first player (the rows player) while negative numbers mean payoffs to the second player (the columns player). For example, if the first player uses the first strategy (row 1) and the second uses the second strategy (column 2), the first player pays $9 to the second player. This round of play can be represented as \\((1,2)\\). If instead the second player uses the third strategy, the first player gets $8 from the second player.\nIn game theory, the goal is to find the most profitable strategy for each player, i.,e., the strategy that maximizes the payoff or minimizes the payoff to the opponent. Here are important terminologies that we will use in the discussion of the game above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Optimum Strategy\n\n\n\nAn optimum Strategy for any given player in a game is the strategy that results in the most payoff to the player or, in some cases, the least payoff to the opponent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Value of the Game\n\n\n\nThe value of the game is the payoff amount resulting from both players using their optimum strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Fair Game\n\n\n\nA fair game is a game with a value of zero. This means that no player takes a loss.\n\n\nIn order to determine the value of the game, we will need to look at the possibilities that player 2 has when player one chooses strategy 1, 2, and 3. This can be best summarized in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Player 1  chooses\nPlayer B  would choose\nWith a  Payoff of\n\n\n\n\nRow 1\nColumn 2\n$9 to player 2\n\n\nRow 2\nColumn 1\n$2 to player 1\n\n\nRow 3\nColumn 3\n$2 to player 2\n\n\n\nFrom the table above, we can see that the best strategy (optimum strategy) for player 1 is to choose row 2. This is because player 1 is guaranteed a minimum of $2 every time he chooses row 2. Note that player 1 can get more if player 2 messes up by, say, choosing column 3.\nSimilarly, player 2’s best strategy is to choose column 1 because this minimizes the amount that he has to pay to player 1. The value of the game is the payoff at the intersection of row 2 and column 1 (i.e., $2). The is not fair game because the value of the game is not zero.\nNotice that the entry 2 in the payoff matrix is the smallest entry in its row and the largest in its column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Saddle point\n\n\n\nA saddle point in a payoff matrix is the smallest in its row and the largest in its column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Strictly Determined Game\n\n\n\nA strictly determined game is a game containing a saddle point. The value of the game is the payoff at the saddle point.\n\n\nExample 2:\nFor the following payoff matrix,\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n-3 & -2 & \\phantom{-}6\\\\\n\\phantom{-}2 & \\phantom{-}0 & \\phantom{-}2 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}5 & -2 & -4\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nWhat would be the payoff for the strategy (2,3)? Note that here, player 1 (rows) plays strategy 2 while player 2 (columns) plays strategy 3.\nFind the optimum strategy for each player. Recall that player 1 is the row player while player 2 is the column player.\nIs the game strictly determined? Why or why not?\nWhat is the value of the game?\nIs the game fair? Why or why not?\n\nSolution:\n\nThe payoff for the strategy (2,3) is $2 to player 1. This is because player 1 (row 2) pays $2 to player 2 (column 3).\nTo find the optimum strategies for each player, we can start by making a payoff summary table as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Player 1  chooses\nPlayer B  would choose\nWith a  Payoff of\n\n\n\n\nRow 1\nColumn 1\n$3 to player 2\n\n\nRow 2\nColumn 2\n$0 to player 1\n\n\nRow 3\nColumn 3\n$4 to player 2\n\n\n\nBased on the table, the optimum strategy for player 1 is to choose row 2. The optimum strategy for player 2 (assuming player 1 chooses row 2) is to choose column 2. Thus, the optimum strategy is (2,2).\n\nTo determine whether the game is strictly determined we find the saddle point. The smallest entry in each row is -3, 0, and -4 respectively from row 1 to 3. The largest among these is 0. Next, the largest entry in each column is 5, 0, and 6 respectively from column 1 to 3. The smallest among these is 0. Therefore, the saddle point is 0 (recall that saddle point is the largest in its column and the smallest in its row). Since the game has a saddle point, it is a strictly determined game.\nThe value of the game is the payoff at the saddle point. This is $0.\nThe is a fair game because the value of the game is zero. This means that no player takes a loss.\n\nExample 3:\nDetermine whether the following game is strictly determined or not. If it is, find the strategy producing the saddle point then find the value of the game:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n4 & \\phantom{-}7 & -1\\\\\n9 & -2 & \\phantom{-}6 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSolution:\nWe can start by underlining the smallest entry in each row as follows:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n4 & \\phantom{-}7 & \\underline{-1}\\\\\n9 & \\underline{-2} & \\phantom{-}6 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNext, we can bold the largest entry in each column:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\left[\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n4 & \\phantom{-}\\textbf{7} & \\underline{-1}\\\\\n\\textbf{9} & \\underline{-2} & \\phantom{-}\\textbf{6} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right]\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNow, since there is no entry that is both underlined and boldfaced. Therefore, the game has not saddle point and is not strictly determined.\nMany students find this approach of underlining and boldfacing easier to use. I encourage you to try this approach on example 2 above.",

    "text": "9.1 Intro to Simple Interest\nIf you lend someone $5000 today and that person pays you back in 1 year, you probably want them to pay you more than $ 5000 (say, $ 5,500). Borrowing money is not free. We use the term Present value (abbreviated as \\(P\\)) to refer to the value of money at the moment and Future Value (abbreviated as \\(F\\)) to refer to the value of the money at a future date.\nWe use the term Interest (abbreviated as \\(I\\)) to refer to the difference between the future value and the present value. You can think of interest as the value gained by the present value over a time period, \\(t\\). In other words, interest is the difference between the future value and the present value of the money.\nIf the person to whom you lend the money keeps it for two years instead of one, what would be the interest? What if they keep it for 10 years? Well, this will depend on the terms of payment that the two of you agree on. assuming you agree on a flat rate or $500 every year, they would pay a total interest of \\((10\\times500=\\$5000)\\) if they keep the money for ten years and $1000 for two years.\nThe term interest rate refers to the proportion (percentage) of a loan that is charged as interest to the borrower. Interest rates are typically expressed as an annual percentage of the amount borrowed. For example, in the above scenario, the interest rate would be \\[\\frac{500}{5000} \\times 100=10\\%\\] This means that \\(10\\%\\) of the present value \\((0.1\\times5000=500)\\) is paid as interest every year. We usually use the letter \\(r\\) to denote interest rate. Thus, for an interest rate of \\(r\\), a present value \\(P\\) and time \\(t\\) years, one should expect to pay an interest of \\(P\\times r \\times t=Prt\\).\nNote:",

    "text": "9.4 Exact and Approximate Time\nConsider the following scenario:\nWhile paying off student loans, you notice that the amount of interest you have to pay off each month changes by month. You expect this to go down, since the amount you owe goes down (so there is less money to charge interest on). But some months the amount of interest actually goes up. How is that possible?\nIt turns out that the above scenario is caused by the fact that some months are longer (have more days) than others. Financial institutions take into consideration the number of days while computing the interest they charge their clients. The number of days can be either approximate or exact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefitnition (Approximate Time)\n\n\n\nApproximate time: assumes that every month has 30 days. In order to compute the approximate time that has passed between two calendar dates, count the number of full months in the loan period, and multiply them by 30. Then add in the extra days included in the loan (less than a month) period using exact time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefitnition (Exact Time\n\n\n\nExact time: refers to the exact count of number of days that have passed.\n\n\nNow, how about the number of days in a year? In the world of banking, sometimes they use 360 as the number of days in a year and sometimes they use 365 (you may see this in terms and conditions section for various products such as credit cards). Remember that in the formula for interest \\((I=Prt)\\), time, \\(t\\), is expressed in years. When banks convert days to years they will either divide by 360 or by 365. Note that using 360 days in a year benefits the bank because the quantity \\(t\\) will be higher and thus the interest paid increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefitnition (Oedinary Interest\n\n\n\n*Ordinary interest: calculates interest by assuming a total of 360 days in a year. (i.e., this is the denominator of your fraction of a year when calculating time.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefintion (Banker’s Rule)\n\n\n\nBanker’s Rule says that, when you are calculating the length of a loan on the order of days, you use exact time but with ordinary interest. In other words, you calculate t (the length of the loan) using exact time, but use 360 as the number of days in a year.\n\n\nExample 3\nFind the approximate time (days) between August 29 and December 14\nSolution\nWe have the whole of Sep, Oct, and Nov. Each of those will be assumed to have 30 days (see definition of approximate time above).\nNext, we have the 14 days into Dec and the 1 day before the start of Sep for a total of 15. Therefore, the approximate time is \\[(3\\times 30)+15=105 \\text{days}\\]\nExample 4\nFind the exact time (days) between August 29 and December 14\nSolution\nLeft as an exercise.\n\n9.4.1 Exact Time Table\nThe table below gives the serial numbers for each day of the year. For example, Jan 1 has serial number 1 while Feb 1 has serial number 32. What this means is that you can easily find the exact number of days between two dates by subtracting their serial numbers.\n\n\n\nSerial Numbers for Dates\n\n\nFrom the table above, Dec 14 is day number 348 of the year. Similarly, Aug 28 is day number 241. So, the exact number of days between these two dates is \\[348-241=107.\\]\nExample 5 Henry borrows $1500 on Aug 3, 2023. If interest is 8.5%, determine the amount that he must repay on Dec 23, 2023. Use the Banker’s Rule.\nSolution\nFirst, the question is asking us to find the future value \\((F)\\). The formula for future value was given as \\(F=P(1+rt).\\)\nWe know \\(P=1500\\) and \\(r=\\frac{8.5}{100}=0.085\\). Since we are using the Banker’s Rule, we have to find the exact time between the given dates but use 360 for converting the days into years. Using the table above, \\(Days = 357-215=142.\\)\nThus,\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nF&=P(1+rt)\\\\\n&=1500\\left[1+ \\left(0.085\\times \\frac{142}{360}\\right)\\right]\\\\\n&=\\$1550.29\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nHenry must pay $1550.29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefintion (Treasury Bill)\n\n\n\nThe United States government often raises money by selling short term debt securities known as treasury bills (“T-billS”). A Treasury bill is a note whose future value, \\(F\\), is as printed, and whose present value, \\(P\\), is determined by how much one is willing to pay for the note. Treasury bills are usually sold at an auction. For example, if you buy a 1-year $100 T-bill with a bid of 95%, this means that you pay $95 now (present value) to get the note and it will be worth $100 (future value) in 1 year.

    "section": "9.6 Consumer Price Index and Inflation",
    "text": "9.6 Consumer Price Index and Inflation\nWatch the following short video about inflation and consumer price index:\n\n\nMost Americans (and world over) are feeling the effects of inflation. You get the feeling that you can no longer afford the things you did about two years ago. For example, in 2021, a gallon of regular gas went for $3.05 on average but right now, it is going for about $4.00. The cost to mail a first-class letter (one ounce) was $0.33 in 2000 but now it’s $1.06.\nWhile the price of individual items is of some interest, the more important issue is the “cost of living”: how much it costs to pay rent (or make mortgage payments); pay for utilities and insurance; buy groceries, clothing; etc. Economists attempt to measure this with the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nHere’s a rough description of the CPI:\nImagine a “market basket” of all the goods and services that a typical individual needs. Find the cost of these, weight them appropriately (you buy one new pair of shoes each year, a pound of coffee each week, pay your wireless bill once a month [and replace your phone every three years], etc.), and add these costs up. Yes, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does this! By and large, prices are updated on a monthly basis; the market basket is also adjusted over time. (Wireless service was not part of it when the CPI was first developed, for example.)\nThe most commonly used CPI, CPI-U, was scaled so that the value over the period 1982–84 was 100. In 2022, the average CPI was 292.66. This says that, by and large, goods that cost $100 in 1984 would cost $292.66 in 2022. Using the CPI allows us to adjust for inflation.\nBelow is a CPI-U table dating back to 1913. The value for 2023 is the average CPI through September:\n\n\n\nCPI Table (1913 to 2023)\n\n\nA more comprehensive table with month-by-month CPI can be found the BLS website: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\nOne way to use the CPI table above is to compare costs of items at different points in time. This is known as adjusting for inflation and can be done using the formula below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPI formula\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nDollars(B)&=CPI(B) \\times \\frac{Dollars(A)}{CPI(A)}\\\\\n\n\\end{align}\\]\nWhere,\n\\(Dollars(A)=\\) Dollars at time A\n\\(Dollars(B)=\\) Dollars at time B\n\\(CPI(A)=\\) CPI at time A\n\\(CPI(B)=\\) CPI at time B\n\n\nExample 6\nThe federal minimum wage was $0.25 per hour in 1938. Convert this to 2023 dollars. Has the wage gone up or not?\nSolution\n\\[\\begin{align}\nDollars(2023)&=CPI(2023) \\times \\frac{Dollars(1938)}{CPI(1938)}\\\\\n&= 303.4 \\times \\frac{0.25}{14.1}\\\\\n&=5.38\n\\end{align}\\]\nThe current federal minimum wage is $7.25. Thus, the minimum wage has increased by about $1.87 when you account for inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent vs Real Dollar Amount\n\n\n\nIn example 6 above, 0.25 is the current dollar amount while 5.38 is the Real dollar amount in 2023. Note that the “real dollar” amount is only needed for comparison to another amount, and it should be associated with a specific year date.",

    "text": "9.8 Equations Of Value\nWould you rather have $ 1,000 today or $ 1,100 in December?\nThis problem is more complicated than merely comparing the two amounts. The golden rule of finance states that monies cannot be added or reconciled unless they are valued at the same point in time. Therefore, it might make sense to do one of the following before you can make a decision (of course many other factors that may influence your decision):\n\nCompute the future value of $ 1,000 (you will need to know the interest rate) and then compare it with $1,100 OR\nUse $1100 as the future value and compute the present value then compare it with $1,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocal Date\n\n\n\nFocal Date: The focal date is the date to which monies are moved in order to be reconciled (added, subtracted, etc).\n\nIn order to move monies to a given focal date, you will need to know the interest rate at which money is valued.\nWe ignore the effects of inflation in this section and focus only on how available interest rates affect comparisons.\n\n\n\nExample 7\nYou are probably aware that paying a debt early may save you money. Suppose, you owe $3,000 due on Dec 30, 2023. If you decide to pay off this debt early, say Nov, 12, 2023), how much will you pay on Nov, 12, 2023? Assume that money is valued at 5.99% simple interest rate and that there is no penalty for early payment. Use the Banker’s Rule.\nSolution\nNote: The $3,000 is due in future so it is a future value. It already has the interest built in. Paying off early means you should pay less than $3,000.\nTo solve the problem, you first need to identify the focal date. In this case, the focal date is Nov, 12, 2023. \nTo determine how much will be paid on Nov, 12, 2023 to clear the debt, we first compute the exact number of days between 11/12/23 and 12/30/23 using the exact time table given earlier:\n\\(Days=364-316=48\\)\nThis means you save 48 days worth of interest. This is equivalent to moving the money back 48 days from 12/30/23.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF&= P(1+rt) \\\\\n3000&= P\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{5.99}{100} \\times \\frac{48}{360}\\right)\\right]\\\\\n3000&=P \\times 1.007966666\\\\\nP&=2976.23\n\\end{align}\\]\nThings to note about example 7:\n\nYou end up paying less than $3,000 because you are paying early. In this case you are saving about $23.77. The earlier you pay the more you save.\nIf you pay after the due date (i.e., 12/30/23), you expect to pay more than $3,000. In this case, you will compute \\(F\\) instead of \\(P\\). Furthermore, most institutions charge a late payment fee which you have to add the computed future value.\n\nExample 8\nSuppose in example 8 you pay $1,800 on 11/12/203 instead of the full amount owed. How much do you still owe?\nSolution\nAn easy way is to think of the early payment ($1,800) as an investment that earns interest. The question is, what will be the future value of this “investment” on 12/30/23 at an interest rate of 5.99%?\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF&= P(1+rt)\\\\\n&= 1200\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{5.99}{100} \\times \\frac{48}{360}\\right)\\right]\\\\\n&=1800\\times 1.007966666\\\\\n&=1814.34\n\\end{align}\\]\nTo find the amount you still owe on 12/30/23, you subtract $1,814.34 from $3,000 to get $ 1,185.66.",

    "text": "10.1 Introduction to Compound Interest\nWith simple interest, we assumed that the interest, together with the principal amount borrowed or lent out were paid at maturity (i.e., at the end of the investment/loan period). In a standard bank account, any interest earned is automatically added to the principal, and we earn interest on that interest in future.\nAn interesting question we may want to explore is, “how often does compounding happen within the life cycle of a loan or investment?”\nConsider the example in the previous chapter (see section 8.1) where you were lending a friend $5,000 to be paid back after one year. We found that, if you charge your friend an interest rate of 10%, they will have to pay $500 worth of interest by the end of the year. Now, if your friend keeps the money for one more year, under the compound interest arrangement, they will pay the new interest based on $ 5,500 (i.e., the original $ 5000 plus $ 500 interest from the first year). See calculation below:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nInterest \\hspace{.05in} (Year\\hspace{.05in}1)&=Prt\\\\\n&=5000 \\times 0.1\\times 1\\\\\n&=\\$500\\\\\nTotal\\hspace{.05in} Year\\hspace{.05in}1 &= 5000+500\\\\\n&=5,500\\\\\n\nInterest \\hspace{.05in} (Year\\hspace{.05in}2)&=Prt\\\\\n&=5500 \\times 0.1\\times 1\\\\\n&=\\$550\\\\\nTotal(\\hspace{.05in} Year\\hspace{.05in}2) &= 5500+550\\\\\n&=\\$6050\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\nYou can continue with this trend for as long as your friend keeps the money. Of course, the longer they keep the money, the higher the interest hay pay. In the case where they keep the money for only two years, the end up paying an interest of \\(6050-6000=\\$1050\\). If you had charged your friend simple interest instead of compound interest, they would have to pay an interest of $1,000 only (see computation below for simple interest).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nI&=Prt\\\\\n&=5000\\times 0.1\\times2\\\\\n&=\\$1000\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn the above example, compounding happens once every year and so we have two compounding periods (Year 1 and Year 2) in total. If compounding were to happen every six months instead (twice a year), we would have a total of four compounding periods.\nIn the above example, how many compounding periods would you have in total if the compounding period were one month?\nIn calculating compound interest, it is important to know the interest rate per compounding period. In the above example where the interest rate is 10% with two compoundings, the interest rate per period is \\(i=\\frac{r}{2}\\)",

For the simple interest, you can get the future value directly by using the formula \\(F=P(1+rt)\\) from the previous chapter. For compound interest, the formula is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate per compounding period\n\n\n\n\\[\nF=P(1+i)^n\n\\]\nWhere,\n\\(F=\\) Future Value\n\\(i=\\) interest rate per compounding period\n\\(n=\\) total number of compounding periods.\n\n\nLet us use the above formula to check whether we get the $6050 that we found earlier in the example where your friend borrows $5000 for two years at an interest rate of 10% compounded every year (once a year).\nFirst, we calculate the interest rate per compounding period. Since there is only one compounding period per year, \\(m=1\\). Thus, \\(i=\\frac{0.1}{1}=0.1\\).\nNext, we compute the total number of compounding periods. Since the loan is for 2 years and there is only one compounding per year, we have \\(n=mt=1\\times 2=2\\) periods. Therefore,\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF&=5000(1+0.1)^2\\\\\n&=6050\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn the above example, if we assume that the compounding happens every six months, we would have to change both \\(i\\) and \\(n\\) accordingly. In writing interest rates under compound interest, we often write the compounding period in parenthesis. For example, if compounsing happens every six months (twice a year), we would the rate as \\(10\\%(2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresenting Compound Interest\n\n\n\nWe write interest rate as \\(r\\%(m)\\)\nWhere,\n\\(r\\%=\\) the raw interest rate (not divided by 100)\n\\(m=\\) compounding period.\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose you open up a savings account that pays \\(6\\%(12)\\) with $1,000. How much will you have in this account after 10 years?\nSolution\nFirst, note the interest rate, \\(6\\%(12)\\), means that compounding happens every month (12 times a year).\nWe can calculate the interest earned in the first year first month, add it to 1000, and then calculate the interest earned in the second month, add it back ,etc but this would be a cumbersome and long process. We can use the formula given earlier:\nThe formula is \\(F=P(1-i)^n\\). We know that \\(P=1,000\\).\nWe find \\(i=\\frac{0.06}{12}=0.005\\) and \\(n=12\\times10=120\\)\nWe now plug in these numbers into the future value formula under compound interest as follows\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF&=P(1+i)^n\\\\\n&=1,000(1+0.005)^{120}\\\\\n&=1,819.40\n\\end{align}\\]",

    "text": "10.6 APR vs APY\nDefinition: The annual percentage rate (APR) is the annual interest rate that gets compounded over a number of interest periods.\n\nNote that in order to compute compound interest, we need to know both the APR and how many times per year interest is compounded (e.g., in 4%(12), the 4% is the APR and the 12 is the number of times per year the interest is compounded).\n\nDefinition: The annual percentage yield (APY) is the simple interest rate that would yield the same amount of interest over one year as the compound interest rate actually gives.\nSince the amount of interest earned from compound interest depends on how many times it is compounded per year, it can be difficult to compare different rates with different compounding times (e.g., try to compare 7.1%(4) to 6.9%(12)). In order to make a direct comparison, we can determine the equivalent rate when compounded once per year (e.g., 7.1%(4) is equivalent yearly to 7.29%(1), while 6.9%(12) is equivalent yearly to 7.12%(1)). You can now see that 7.1%(4) is higher because it will yield more in one year than 6.9%(12). These new rates are essentially simple interest rates restricted to one year. These rates are known as APYs (Annual Percentage Yields). We use \\(r\\) to represent APR and \\(R\\) to represent APY.\nWe use the following fo0rmula to convert APR’s into APY’s:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPR to APY conversion Formula\n\n\n\n\\[\nR = \\left(1+\\frac{r}{m}\\right)^m -1\n\\]\nWhere, \\(R=\\) Annual Percentage Yield (APY). \\(r=\\) the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). \\(m=\\) number of compounding periods per year.\n\n\nExample 4\nConvert \\(24.44\\% (12)\\) to an APR.\nSolution\nHere, we shall use the APR-APY conversion formula directly.

So, Jamie needs to choose the bank that offers a cheaper loan. To do this, we can convert the two APR’s into APY’s for easy comparison.\nPlease complete the solution.",

The answer to this question is YES.

    "text": "11.6 Formula for the Present Value of an Annuity\nWhat if the donor wanted the college to be able to withdraw 50K every six months for a period of 30 years? How much should the donor give? Well, using the above process would be tedious and prone to errors.\nTo find the present value of an annuity, we can use the following formula (developed through in-class activity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula for Present Value of an Annuity\n\n\n\n\\[\nP = R\\left[\\frac{1-(1+i)^{-n}}{i} \\right]\n\\]\nWhere,\n\\(P=\\) Present Value\n\\(i=\\) Recurring (or repeating) payment/withdrawal\n\\(n=\\) total number of payments\n\\(i=\\) interest rate per compounding period, (i.e., \\(i=\\frac{r}{m}\\))\n\n\nLet us use the present value formula for the donor scenario above,\nWe have, \\(R=50,000\\), \\(n=4\\), and \\(i=\\frac{0.06}{2}=0.03\\)\nThus,\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP &= 50000\\left[\\frac{1-(1+0.03)^{-4}}{0.03} \\right]\\\\\\\\\n  &=\\$ 185,854.92\n\\end{align}\\]\nExample 3\nJayne is a freshman in college. She has an online savings account that pays interest at the rate of 7.99%(12). Her parents want to deposit money in this bank account so that Jayne can withdraw $2,500 every month for four months. What is the minimum amount that should be deposited in Jayne’s account?\nSolution\nFirst, note that this problem is asking for the present value (P) of an annuity. If Jayne’s account were paying no interest, she would need 10K deposited (i.e., 2500 times 4). Since the account earns some interest, we know that the parents will need to deposit less than 10K.\nWe have that \\(R=2,500\\), \\(n = 4\\), and \\(i=\\frac{0.0799}{12}=0.00665833\\)\nNext, plug these values into the formula as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP &= 2500\\left[\\frac{1-(1+0.00665833)^{-4}}{0.00665833} \\right]\\\\\\\\\n  &=\\$ 9,835.73\n\\end{align}\\]\nExample 4\nSuppose that in example 3 above, Jayne’s parents deposited $ 15,000. How much will Jayne be able to withdraw monthly for four months?\nSolution\nNotice that this problem still requires the use of the present value an an annuity formula. However, the unknown quantity here is \\(R\\). We can proceed as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n15000 &= R\\left[\\frac{1-(1+0.00665833)^{-4}}{0.00665833} \\right]\\\\\\\\\n      &= R \\times 3.9342931446\\\\\\\\\n  R &= \\frac{15000}{3.9342931446}\\\\\\\\\n  &= \\$ 3,812.63\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, if Jayne’s parents deposited $15,000, Jayne would be able to withdraw about $ 3,812.63 every month for 4 months.",
