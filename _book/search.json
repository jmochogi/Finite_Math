    "text": "2.1 Definitions and Notation for Linear Functions\nAs you hop into a taxicab in Allentown, the meter will immediately read $3.30; this is the “drop” charge made when the taximeter is activated. After that initial fee, the taximeter will add $2.40 for each mile the taxi drives. In this scenario, the total taxi fare depends upon the number of miles ridden in the taxi, and we can ask whether it is possible to model this type of scenario with a function. Using descriptive variables, we choose \\(m\\) for miles and \\(C\\) for Cost in dollars as a function of miles: \\(C(m)\\).\nHere, \\(C(0)\\) means the cost for travelling 0 miles (assuming you have entered the taxi). This cost is \\(\\$3.3\\). We can write this mathematically as\nC(0)=3.3\nSimilarly, \\(C(2)\\) is the cost of travelling 2 miles and can be computed as\nC(2) = 3.3 + (2.4 x 2) = 8.1\nHere, we take the base charge of \\(\\$3.3\\) and add it to the charge for riding 2 miles to get a grand total of 8.1.\nIn general, if we travel \\(m\\) miles, we can compute the cost as\nC(m)=3.3 + 2.4m\nIt is often useful to think carefully about the units of each component and how they relate. The expression below shows how this plays out in our taxi context:\n\\[C(m)=3.3 \\hspace{.1in} dollars + 2.4 \\hspace{.08in} \\frac{dollars}{mile} \\times m\\hspace{.1in} miles\\]\nWhen dollars per mile are multiplied by a number of miles, the result is a number of dollars, matching the units on the 3.30, and matching the desired units for the C function. This means the units for the output, C(m), will be dollars.\nWe call a relationship such as this, a Function of \\(m\\). This function takes \\(m\\) (the miles traveled) as the Input and produces \\(C(m)\\) (the cost of travelling \\(m\\) miles) as the Output. As you will learn shortly, this is an example of a Linear Function. There are other types of functions (e.g., exponential, quadratic, etc.). In this course, the main focus is on linear functions. We will learn how to model real life situations and find their solutions by leveraging the ideas learned under linear functions.\nThere are two parts to the function, the first part (3.3) represents the FIXED charge while the VARIABLE part, \\(2.4m\\) which represents the charge for m miles. The cost of a ride, \\(C(m)\\) will vary as the number of miles, \\(m\\) varies. Furthermore, this cost varies by a factor of 2.4 which means that for every additional mile you ride, you will pay \\(\\$ 2.4\\) more. We call the value \\(2.4\\) a Rate of Change for the function \\(C(m)\\). Since this rate of change stays the same over any interval, we say that the rate is Constant."

Functions can also be represented using tables and graphs.\nConsider the table below:\nHave table here\nWe can also represent the function using a graph as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the graph, we place the miles on the horizontal axis and the cost on the vertical axis axis. Since the cost is dependent on the miles traveled, we call it a Dependent Variable. Similarly, we call the miles, an Independent Variable.\nIf you ride 0 miles, the cost is $3.30, giving the point (0, 3.30) on the graph. We call this, the vertical or C(m)-intercept (or y-intercept in a general graph using x and y). In many applications, the y-intercept often means the initial value (e.g., cost) when the x value (in this case miles) is zero.\nWe call the above function, a Linear Function because its graph produces a straight line. In general, linear functions take the form \\(f(x)=mx+b\\) where \\(m\\) is the Slope (or rate of change) and \\(b\\) is the y-intercept.

    "section": "2.4 Calculating Rate of Change",
    "text": "2.4 Calculating Rate of Change\nThe rate of change (ROC) is perhaps the most important component of any linear function. As we have seen, it can tell you whether the function is increasing or decreasing and can be used to create a linear model for a given real life situation. The question that arises is, “how can we compute the rate of change from given data?”. In the earlier taxi example, suppose, we did not know the rate of change but knew the cots of riding 4 miles and 7 miles. How can we use this information together with the fact that the function is linear to find the rate of change?\nIn the following examples we explore ways of finding the rate of change and how to use it to create the linear function/model for given real-life situations.\nExample 1\nThe population of a city can be modeled using a linear function. In 2002, the population was 23,400 and in 2006, it was 27,800.\n\nFind the rate of change of the population for this city.\nWrite down the formula of the linear function for the scenario.\nAssuming the model (function) holds true until 2024, what would be the population of the town in 2024?\n\nSolution\n\nSince we are told that the population grows linearly, we know that the growth between 2002 and 2003 is the same as the growth between 2003 and 2004, etc. Thus, to find the rate of change (i.e., population growth per year), we can divide the population change between 2002 and 2006 by the number of years as shown:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nRate\\hspace{.04in} of\\hspace{.04in} change &=  \\frac{pop. \\hspace{.04in} in \\hspace{.04in} 2006 \\hspace{.04in}- pop. \\hspace{.04in} in \\hspace{.04in} 2002}{2006-2002}\\\\&= 1100\\hspace{.04in} people\\hspace{.04in} per \\hspace{.04in} year\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nIf we use 2002 as the base year(i.e., t=0), then the constant value in the function is 23,400. Next, since we have the rate of change, all we need is to write the function in the form \\(f(x)=mx+b\\) where \\(m\\) is the rate of change and \\(b\\) is the constant or initial value, and t is time in years.\n\n\\[f(t) = 1100t+23,400\\]\n\nFor 2024, \\(t=22\\) years. Thus,\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(22) &= 1100\\times22+23,400\\\\&=47,600\n\\end{align}\\]\nExample 2\nThe summit of Africa’s largest peak, Mt. Kilimanjaro, has two main ice fields and a glacier at its peak. Geologists measured the ice cover in the year 2000 (\\(t = 0\\)) to be approximately \\(1951\\hspace{.05in}m^2\\); in the year 2007, the ice cover measured \\(1555 \\hspace{.05in}m^2\\).\n\nSuppose that the amount of ice cover at the peak of Mt. Kilimanjaro is changing at a constant average rate from year to year. Find a linear model, \\(A=f(t)\\) whose output is the area, A, in square meters in year \\(t\\) (where is the number of years after 2000).\nWhat do the slope and \\(A\\)-intercept mean in the model you found in (a)? In particular, what are the units on the slope?\n\n\n\nCompute \\(f(17)\\). What does this quantity measure? Write a complete sentence to explain.\n\n\n\nIf the model holds further into the future, when do we predict the ice cover will vanish?\n\nSolution\n\nWe begin by finding the rate of change. Since we know that the rate of change is constant year after year, we can divide the change between 2007 and 2000 by 7 to get the rate of change. \\[\\begin{align}\nRate\\hspace{.04in} of\\hspace{.04in} change &=  \\frac{Coverage \\hspace{.04in} in \\hspace{.04in} 2007 \\hspace{.04in}- Coverage \\hspace{.04in} in \\hspace{.04in} 2000}{2007-2000}\\\\\n&= - 56.57\\hspace{.04in} m^2\\hspace{.04in} per \\hspace{.04in} year\n\\end{align}\\]  The general format of a linear function is \\(A(t)=mt+b\\) where \\(m\\) is the rate of change and \\(b\\) is the \\(A(t)\\)-intercept (or the value of \\(A(0)\\) which we know is 1951).  Thus, the function is,\n\n\\[A(t)=-56.57t + 1951\\]\n\nThe slope means that the ice for every additional year, the ice coverage decreases by \\(56.57 m^2\\). The units are square meters per year (\\(m^2/year\\)). The y intercept means that the initial coverage at year zero (when the measurement was first taken) is \\(1951 m^2\\).\n\\(f(17)=(-55.57\\times17)+1951=1006.31\\); This means that there were \\(1006.31 mi^2\\) of ice coverage on Mt. Kilimanjaro by 2017 (i.e., 17 years after 2000).\nRemember that \\(A(t)\\) is the function that gives the ice cover after to years. Therefore, if the ice cover is zero, it means \\(A(t)=0\\). We compute \\(t\\) by solving the equation \\(-56.57t + 1951=0\\) for t.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  -56.57t + 1951&=0\\\\\n  -56.57t&=-1951\\\\\n  t&=\\frac{-1951}{-56.57}\\\\\n  t&=34.49 \\hspace{0.04in} years\n  \\end{align}\\]\n\n2.4.1 A Formula For ROC\nFrom the foregoing examples, it should be readily clear that, on any interval \\((x_1,x_2)\\) where \\(x_1\\neq x_2\\),\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  Rate \\hspace{0.04in}of\\hspace{0.04in} Change                         \n  &=\\frac{Change\\hspace{0.04in}in\\hspace{0.04in}Output}{Change \\hspace{0.04in}         \n  in\\hspace{0.04in}Input}\\\\\n  &=\\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\n  \\end{align}\\]\nExample 3\nIf \\(f(x)\\) is a linear function, \\(f(3)=−2\\), and \\(f(8)=1\\), find an equation/formula for the function.\nSolution\nIn this problem, we are looking at the input interval between 3 and 8. Thus, \\(x_1=3\\) and \\(x_2=8\\). To find the ROC for \\(f(x)\\) we proceed as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nROC &= \\frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}\\\\\n&= \\frac{f(3)-f(1)}{8 - 3}\\\\\n&= \\frac{1-(-2)}{5}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3}{5}\n\\end{align}\\] Next, the general form of the linear function is \\(f(x)=mx+b\\), where \\(m\\) is the ROC (aka slope. So, we can write, \\(f(x)=\\frac{3}{5}x+b\\). To find \\(b\\), we can use one of the known values of \\(f(x)\\), such as \\(f(8)\\) and solve for \\(b\\) as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf(8)&=\\frac{3}{5}\\times (8)+b\\\\\n1&=\\frac{24}{5}+b\\\\\nb&=1-\\frac{24}{5}\\\\\n&=-\\frac{19}{5}\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo, the equation becomes,\n\\[f(x)=\\frac{3}{5}x-\\frac{19}{5}\\]"

For example, production managers often make decisions on what products to manufacture and in what quantities. In making such decisions, the manager must consider the available resources and how to utilize them for maximum profit. Note that resources are not limited to raw materials. They can include labor (human hours), farmland, machinery, etc. Resources, in general, are always limited and management must decide how to allocate them in order to get the maximum possible profit.\nLinear programming (LP) is one of the most important methods used in management science to solve problems of the kind describe above. LP involves maximizing or minimizing a quantity, usually profit or cost, under some given constraints."

    "section": "3.3 The Geometric Method",
    "text": "3.3 The Geometric Method\nThe geometric method of solving linear programming problems involves creating a graph to visualize the feasible region (the set of likely solutions) and then identifying a solution from the feasible region.\nA feasible set (region) for an LP problem is the collection of all physical\npossible solution choices that can be made. \n\n3.3.1 Convering Mixture Chart into Mathematical Form\nFirst, we know that the we cannot manufacture negative number of objects (skateboards of dolls). So, negative numbers are not permitted in this context. Note however, that 0 is a possible number. Thus, we have two inequalities;\n\\[x \\ge 0 \\hspace{.04in} \\text{and} \\hspace{.04in} y \\ge 0\\]\nThe symbol \\(&gt;\\) means grater than while \\(\\ge\\) means greater than or equal to.\nWe call the above two inequalities minimum constraints because they tell us the minimum that we can have for each object.\nSince we have a limited supply of resources (in this case 60 units of plastic) we must also have inequalities for resource constraints. Since we need 5 units of plastic to manufacture ONE skateboard, we will need \\(5x\\) units to manufacture x units of skateboards. Similarly, we will need \\(2y\\) units of plastic to manufacture y dolls. In total, we need \\(5x+2y\\) units of plastic to manufacture the dolls and skateboard. This value must not exceed 60. Thus, we have the inequality,\n\\[5x+2y\\le60\\]\nNotice that this time, we use the symbol for less than or equal to.\nIn this problem, we only have 3 inequalities but in a realistic problem, there would be hundreds or even thousands of them.\nThe last step in formulating the mathematical model is to make the objective function. This is the the function that connects the profit to the resources. Since we know that each skateboard results in $1.00 profit, we know that x dolls will result in a profit of \\(\\$1x\\) and y dolls will result in a profit of \\(\\$0.55x\\). We do not know what the profit is but we know it is a function of both dolls and skateboards. We can denote the profit as \\(P\\). So, we have the equation,\n\\[P=1x+0.55y\\] Notice that the objective function is an equation (not inequality) that gives a specific amount of profit as we vary the number of skateboards and dolls. In other words, \\(P\\) changes as we change \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). So we can determine the value of \\(x\\) and\\(y\\) that would produce maximum \\(P\\).\n\n\n3.3.2 Representing the Feasible Region\nAfter creating the inequalities from the mixture chart, we can draw a helpful picture to help us visualize the feasible region geometrically. Graphs are the most commonly used tools for visualizing the feasible region.\nNotice that all the three inequalities (i.e., the minimum and resource constraints) are linear in the sense that when you graph them (assuming an equal sign) you will get a straight line. To take care of the fact that the inequalities admit a broad range of values, we,\n\nUse a dotted line if the inequality is strictly less \\((&lt;)\\) or greater \\((&gt;)\\) and shade the region representing the constraints. For example, \\(x&gt;0\\), represents the \\(y-axis\\) so we draw a dotted line there and shade the right side of the line (i.e., values for which \\(x&gt;0\\).\nUse a bold line if the inequality allows equality (e.g., \\(x\\ge0\\)). In this case, we would draw the same line as (a) above but without dotting it (i.e, a continuous line.\n\nBelow is a graph of the feasible region for our problem above\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph of the Feasible Region\n\n\n\n\nAll points within the region labelled “feasible region” are possible solution to our problem in the sense that they do not violate the constraints. For example, if we take the point \\((8,4\\) as the solution, the company would need to manufacture 8 skateboards and 4 dolls We can use the profit function to compute the profit associated with this choice as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP&=x+0.55y\\\\\n&=8+(0.55\\times 4)\\\\\n&=\\$10.20\n\\end{align}\\]\nAlthough this solution does not violate the constraints, it is easy to show that there is another point that would yield a higher profit while still obeying the constraints. Take, for example, the point \\((2,14)\\) which means 2 skateboards and 20 dolls. The profit for this choice would be higher. See below:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nP&=1.00 x+0.55y\\\\\n&=2+(0.55\\times 20)\\\\\n&=\\$13.0\n\\end{align}\\]\nChoosing the point in the feasible region that would result in maximum profit (optimal production policy) is not a trivial task. However, there is an genius technique known as The Corner Point Principle which we discuss next:\n\n\n3.3.3 The Corner Point Principle\nThe corner point principle has been touted as one of the most important insights into the theory of linear programming. The principle states that,\nIn a linear programming problem, the maximum value for the profit formula always\ncorresponds to a corner point of the feasible region.\nFor our linear programming problem above, there are three corners with cor=ordinates \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,30\\), and \\((12,0)\\). So, we can compute the profit associated with these 3 points and choose the highest as our optimal production policy:\nFor \\((0,0)\\), the profit would be \\(\\$0\\).\nFor \\((0,30\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (0)x+0.55(30)=\\$16.5\\)\nFor \\((12,0\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (12)x+0.55(0)=\\$12.00\\)\nTherefore, the optimal production policy would be to manufacture 0 skateboards and 30 dolls.\nNOTE: In the real world, there would be a lot more corners which would make this process cumbersome. However, as you may have guessed, there are computer programs that can do the job faster and more efficiently than humans.\n\n\n3.3.4 Summary of the Geometric Method\n\nRead the problem carefully to identify resources and products.\nMake a mixture chart for the problem.\nAssign an unknown quantities (often \\(x\\), and \\(y\\)) to each product and use the mixture chart to write the resource and minimum constraints.\nWrite the profit formula as well.\nCreate a feasible region by graphing ther inequalities (you can use a program such as Geogebra or Desmos).\nFind the coordinates of the corner points and evaluate the profit for each. The corner that gives maximum profit is the optimal production policy.\n\nIn the next example, we extend the toy problem above to include one more resource (person minutes). Read below:\nExample 2\nA toy manufacturer can manufacture only skateboards and, only dolls, or some kind of skateboards and dolls. Skateboards require 5 units of plastic and can be sold for a profit of $ 1, while dolls require 2 units of plastic and can be sold for $0.55 profit. Only 60 units of plastic are available. Furthermore, making one skateboard requires 15 person-minutes while making one doll requires 18-person minutes. There are only 360person person-minutes available.\n\nMake a mixture chart to model this situation.\nWhat numbers of skateboards and/or dolls should the company make to maximize profit?\n\nSolution\n\nBelow is the new mixture chart,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\nResource 1: Plastic: 60\nResource 2: person-minutes  360\nProfit\n\n\n\n\nSkateboard  (x units)\n5\n15\n$ 1.00\n\n\nDolls(y units)\n2\n18\n$ 0.55\n\n\n\n\nWe start by writing down the inequalities (constraints) and the profit function. We still have the same minimum constraints as from example 1: \\[x \\ge 0 \\hspace{.04in} \\text{and} \\hspace{.04in} y \\ge 0\\] For the resource constraints, we have two inequalities because we have two resources: For the plastic, we have \\[5x+2y\\le60\\]  For the person hours, we have, \\[15x + 18y \\le 360\\]  The profit function stays the same: \\[P=1x+0.55y\\]  Next, we create a feasible region by graphing the inequalities. Notice that this new feasible region is smaller than the first and it has four corner points. The fourth point is as a result of the new inequality created by the additional resource constraints. As indicated earlier, the more resources you have, the more the corner points you expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated Feasible Region\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to use the corner principle to find the optimal production policy: We check the profits for each of the corner:\nFor \\((0,0)\\), the profit would be \\(\\$0\\).\nFor \\((0,20\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (0)x+0.55(20)=\\$11.00\\)\nFor \\((6,15\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (6)x+0.55(15)=\\$14.50\\)\nFor \\((12,0\\), the profit would be, \\(P=1.00 (12)x+0.55(0)=\\$12.00\\)\nThus, in this new problem, the optimal production policy is 6 skateboards and 15 dolls for a maximum profit of $ 14.50."

In cases where you only know one of the points, say \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and the slope \\(m\\) you can express the equation of the line as follows:\n\\[y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\] Where, \\((x_1,y_1)\\) is the KNOWN point.\nAfter this, you can then rearrange the equation into the slope-intercept format. You just need to be careful with your algebraic manipulation when doing this. See example below:\nExample 4\nA new house was sold for $296000 8 years after it was purchased. The original owners calculated that the house appreciated $2,500 per year while they owned it.

We also know the cost after 8 years (i.e, we know one point \\((8, 296,000)\\)).\nWe can use this information and the concept of slope-point format to write the equation of the line as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\ny-y_1&=m(x-x_1)\\\\\ny-296,000&=2500(x-8)\\\\\ny-296,000&=2500x-20,000\\\\\ny&=2500x-20000+296,000\\\\\ny&=2500x+276,000\n\\end{align}\\]\nNote that in the above equation, \\(y=C(x)\\). So we are done. As a bonus, we know the cost of the house was $276,000 eight years ago."

    "text": "2.6 Intersecting Lines\nAs you saw earlier, we can represent linear functions using graphs. By examining graphs of linear functions, we are able to tell whether the function is increasing (positive slope), decreasing (negative slope) or neither (zero slope).\nWhat would happen if you graph two lines with the same slope but different vertical (y) intercepts? What would the lines look like?\nHere is a claim: If two linear functions have different slopes, then, their lines must intersect at some point. Do you think this claim is true? Why or why not?\nSupply and demand problems are sometimes modeled using linear functions. When the demand and supply meet (intersect) we have an equilibrium point. Consider the following example:\nExample 5\nThe supply, in thousands of items, for custom phone cases can be modeled by the equation, \\(s(p)=0.5+1.2p\\) while the demand can be modeled by \\(d(p)=8.7−0.7p\\), where p is in the price in dollars. Find the equilibrium price and quantity, the intersection of the supply and demand curves.\nSolution\nThere are two ways to solve this problem. First, you can set up \\(s(p)=d(p)\\) then solve algebraically for \\(p\\) or simply graph the two functions then look at the point of intersection.\nLet us do both.\nAlgebraic solution :\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  0.5+1.2p&=8.7−0.7p\\\\\n  1.2p+0.7p&=8.7-0.5\\\\\n  1.9p&=8.2\\\\\n  p&=\\frac{8.2}{1.9}\\\\\n  &=4.32\n\\end{align}\\]\nThus, the equilibrium price is approximately $4.32.\nTo find the quantity, use any of the two functions to evaluate the output at \\(p=4.32\\). Note that the answers will be the same same the two functions intersect when \\(p=4.32\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\ns(4.32)&=0.5+(1.2\\times 4.32)\\\\\n&= 5.68\n\\end{align}\\]\nGraphical solution :\nFor the graphical solution, you simply graph the two functions and read out the cordinates of the intersection point.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approximate point of intersection for the graphs is \\((4.3,5.6)\\). You can get more accurate values using technology. This intersection is a pair \\((x,y)\\) where the first number is the price (input) and the second if the quantity (output). Thus, the equilibrium price is $4.3 and the quantity is 5.6 units. This answer is the same as the one using the algebraic approach."
